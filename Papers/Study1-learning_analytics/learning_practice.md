Hands-on active learning approach to teaching information analytics

We study young information analysts who do not have a established practice but are in the process of learning analytic techniques. These young analysts' behaviors thus are easily shaped by the teaching methods and available tools. We report their learning problem and examine in what areas our tool helps or impedes their learning information analytics.

Collaborative learning helps students take a structured approach to solve a problem. In order to make teammates understand one's hypotheses, individuals must externalization their mental model. This communication and externalization process helps students reflect on the process, as Heuer [@Heuer1999] claims

Before our study, we observed and took notes of how teams of students accomplished a course project.

The task required teams to submit a report explaining hypotheses and findings, as well as created analytic products that supported their analysis, and gave recommendations of IEW table, ACH Matrix, timeline, and network graph. The intention of the project was to provide students practice opportunities to apply and blend multiple analytic techniques to problem solving.

Because the analytic tools could only be used by a single user at a time, an intuitive approach teams employed for coordination was to divide labor by tools. One team member categorized all evidence into an IEW table, another individual extracted events and organized them into a timeline, and the third member linked entities to his best knowledge and drew a network graph. After individuals completed their own work, they put the products together as their collective efforts. This simple "divide and conquer" strategy obviously does not serve of purpose of collaborative information analysis training as the goal of the course project 

In a worse case, students created analytic products *after* the team had reached a conclusion. The team read through all the documents and extracted related evidence. They then discussed hypotheses and agreed on a framework of the problem. They then create analytic products to account for the their hypothesis. This process only strengthened their confirmation bias.

We also observed that teams could share

We posit that such loosely coupled collaboration behavior is partly shaped by the tools available. The constraint of single-user tools discourages teams to contribute simultaneously; instead, teams seek for more efficient approaches and divide labor by tools. One example is likely to support our argument and that team behavior might change if tools become collaborative. Instead of using Microsoft Word for editing IEW table, one team created a shared Google Doc. The team thus could, and indeed did, edit the table at the same time. The team also had more discussions when they were creating the IEW table as they tried to figure out how to categorize evidence in the table. The observation further motivated us to deploy a collaborative information analysis tool in class and investigate their behavior change if any.
