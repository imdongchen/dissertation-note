Anecdotal reflections from the instructor suggested system support for instructor intervention. During the study, the instructor would go over to students and checked their computer screen on how they were doing. The instructor commented that he valued students' analytic process as much as their final report. The instructor's emphasis on analytic process is consistent with the value of intelligence community, who claimed that analysts *should think about how they make judgements and reach conclusions, not just about the judgments and conclusions themselves* [@Heuer1999]. However, process is hard or costly to capture for assessment, especially in the context of education, where all students are conducting the analysis at the same time. Without explicit support, the instructor has limited supervision over the process.

The collaborative learning instrument is likely to provide an opportunity to get student's analytic traces preserved and assessed because the system has already logged user interactions. These logs are currently reserved for research purposes, but they can also be displayed for assessment purposes. Moreover, taking advantage of the the system's synching capability, the logs can be streamed to a "monitoring dashboard" in real time, from which the instructor could check student's progress and take early intervention if any team deviates the expected path.

Our study suggests that the instrument plays an important role in shaping students' behavior towards more collaborative learning. With traditional single-user tools, students often employ a divide-and-conquer strategy; they divide their job responsibility, work individually on their own part, and put the results together in the end for report submission. In our study, we observed that students spontaneously conducted closer collaboration and enjoyed being able to contribute simultaneously.


An important direction for this research is to explore how such collaborative instrument could be employed to support collaborative learning in other course contexts. We studied an introductory intelligence analysis course, but many other courses involve heavy information analysis tasks, in which snippets of information must be annotated and analyzed with respect to concepts, connections, weights of evidence, and pros and cons of opinions. This is similar to generating and evaluating hypotheses in our case. Thus one could imagine courses in business, new media, and those involving heavy literature review adopting this tool similar to the case described here.
