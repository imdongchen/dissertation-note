# Methods: participants, procedures, and data collection

The context for this study was an undergraduate course in an intelligence training program in a US university. The goal of the program was to train students to become professional intelligence analysts. A key requirement of the course is to emphasize hands-on practice on team-based intelligence analysis. During the first nine weeks, students learnt strategic knowledge (e.g. bottom-up analysis and top-down analysis) and structured analytic techniques, such as IEW for information extraction and weighting (IEW), analysis of competing hypotheses (ACH) and link analysis. Students also had a chance to practice and apply these techniques to solving two small projects, as described in the previous section.

Our study began from the 10th week of the course and lasted for one week. The project task was to investigate into a series of bank robberies. The task was fabricated by the course instructor and had been evolved and refined over years of his teaching. In the task, each team was provided with a set of documents pertaining to seven robberies in the form of witnesses reports, video records, and news media. The task was designed open-ended, which meant that there was no single answer to the task. The instructor explained that the task was to simulate real world scenarios, in which analysts always reasoned in the circumstances of uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity. Participants must make full use of the provided materials and make their best hypotheses with supporting evidence. The instructor told the students that a minimum of 6 hours was expected to complete the project, including in-class and outside-class work. By the end students were required to submit a group report, describing their hypotheses, assumptions, conclusions and supporting evidence.

Students were given a tutorial on CAnalytics a week before the project began. One of the authors first walked students through features of CAnalytics and then let students accomplish a small case analysis on their own step. When the project started, one author was always available to help with any technical issues. Although students were encouraged to make full use of CAnalytics, to ensure a naturalist environment they were always free to apply any other tools that they believed useful. 

Of the 98 students enrolled in the course (from two sections), 73 consented to participate in the study. They were randomly assigned by the instructor into 25 small teams (23 three-person teams and 2 two-person teams). Earlier research indicated that group size was an important factor in group collaboration, thus two-person teams might behave differently from three-person teams. We thus excluded the 2 two-person teams in our current analysis. Also, from the log (and confirmed by their answer to the questionnaire), we find that Team 111 (team IDs were random) spent little time on CAnalytics and mainly used other tools (Google Doc). Their data was also excluded. Thus in this paper we reported result of data from 22 teams in total.


All the students held major in the program of Security and Risk Analysis. Most (75%) of them were in the third academic year (3.05 years in average), indicating that participants in our study had relatively advanced experience and knowledge in intelligence analysis. Participants' age ranged from 19 to 28 (20.3 in average). 77% of the participants were male.



Our collected data includes three aspects: 1. a post-study questionnaire, 2. system log, and 3. team report. In the questionnaire, we includes several 7-index questions measuring individual's self-reported awareness \cite{Convertino2011}, perceived performance \cite{Goyal2014}, and usability (using SUS \cite{}). The questionnaire also included several open-ended questions asking how the tool helped or impeded their work.

The system log is carefully designed so that we capture high-level user activities instead of mouse events and keyboard strokes. For example, we log when the user creates, updates, reads, and deletes an entity. We also log which tool the user is working with. Table~\ref{table:log_schema} shows the schema we use for the log system.

Although there is no single answer to the task problem, there exist several pieces of key evidence that suggest links across different robbery cases. Together with the course instructor (also the creator of the project task), we designed a rubric for grading. For example, whether they captured that Case 3 and Case 5 is much likely to be committed by the same group of robbers; whether they captured that a ``copycat'' in Case 6? The team get one point when they discussed that hypothesis, and get one point when they provide reasonable evidence.
