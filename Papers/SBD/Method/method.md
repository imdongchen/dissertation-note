# Method

To identify Scenario-based Design (SBD) papers, we began with a simple idea that a paper about scenario-based design should include the term 'scenario' or 'scenario based design'. Not all research papers could be found in a single database, and we scoped our search in three large databases: HCI Bibliography [^1], ACM DL and Springer Link. Different databases implement keyword search in slightly different ways. For example, at the time of our research, ACM DL only returned 29 items with the keyword '"scenario-based design"'. Instead, we used 'scenario\*'. Similarly we applied 'scenario\*' for search in HCI Bibliography, and 'scenario-based design' in Springer Link. The results suggested varied numbers of potential SBD papers since 2010: 2139 (HCI Bibliography), 5632 (ACM DL) and 216 (Springer Link). 

The large number of results is partly caused by the general term of 'scenario'. We then limited our search in major HCI outlets. We also briefly scanned through the paper abstract to ensure that the word 'scenario' was used in a relevant context. For example, we checked whether the paper applied scenarios to structure design, reflected on the use of SBD, or extended SBD in some way. At this point we had 93 (HCIBIB), 44 (ACM DL), and ?? (==Springer Link not finished yet==).

Meanwhile, due to the wide range of practitioners and researchers of SBD in the HCI area, we attempted to collect other papers that we might have overlooked by crowdsourcing. We sent out a survey in a popular HCI mail list inquiring people to report their papers about SBD and their use of SBD. However, not many people responded the survey. We got 9 papers.
