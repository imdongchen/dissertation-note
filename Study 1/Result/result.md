## Interaction with team performance

## production blocking
Production blocking refers to the unwillingness or inability to contribute simultaneously when collaboration. Participants reflected that since traditional tools such as Analyst's Notebook and PARC ACH are single-user tools they cannot work on the same tool at the same time. They have to divide their work by tools, work on different information artifacts individually, and put them together in the end. Or they have to follow a sequential work structure, and wait till their teammate finishes using a tool before continuing building on the information artifact. Either approach allows them to work simultaneously on a same analytic product and blocks team production. Participants appreciated the capability of CAnalytics in supporting collaborative artifact building, and keeping them aware of what teammates are doing.

## number of entities
Any information added to complex data analysis potentially contributes to cognitive load to an analyst's work. The unnecessary large number of entities bring extra noise and most information is off the team goal (which is proved by the fact that most entities are not connected and they have not edited by other teammates)

## Territoriality

Although CAnalytics eliminated physical production blocking by allowing simultaneous editing, the issue of social production blocking might still exist, in which participants may avoid editing or deleting others' work, a phenomenon known as territoriality. To test if territoriality exists, we measure the amount of deletions and modifications to others' work versus one's own work.

read self | read others | edit/delete self | edit/delete others
