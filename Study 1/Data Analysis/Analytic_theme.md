# Possible themes for system log data
Kang et al. (2014) defines **sensemaking** as *"a process of making data intelligible by identifying evidence, schematizing and perceiving patterns and anomalies, and, at the highest level, developing insights, hypotheses, and conclusions"*, based upon Pirolli and Card's (2005) sensemaking model. Per that definition, sensemaking includes three major levels:

 1. Evidence
 2. Schematization
 3. Hypothesis generation


<!-- Q: How should I frame the relationship between sensemaking and information analysis?-->
In the context of **collaborative information analysis**, we could try analyzing data in these three themes:

1.  Collaborative evidence identification
2.  Collaborative schematization
3.  Collaborative hypothesis generation

## Collaborative evidence identification

### coordinating

- Result

coordinate strategies for collecting evidence: granularity of evidence, consistency of categorization, division of work (by case, by evidence type)

Participants reflected that

- Discussion

Collapsible data model

### sharing evidence

- What do they share?
	- sharing evidence vs sharing inference
- How do they share?
	- levels of granularity of shared evidence
What is the consequence of sharing evidence?
	e.g. a participant finds a piece of related evidence based on collaborator's sharing; sharing of wrong evidence misleads collaborators; referenced in hypotheses or discussion

### contributing to evidence

- refine other's evidence
- correct other's mistake



## Collaborative schematization
### shared view as resource

## Overal coordination
### tool based coordination
With the simple tool coordinator, participants felt they got better coordinated.
