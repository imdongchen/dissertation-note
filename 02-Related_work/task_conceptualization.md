# The task of collaborative information analysis

## Other collaborative tasks

### Collaborative programming
Collaboration in software development mostly requires coordination; to determine work dependency between developers, according to Guzzi et al. [@Guzzi2015]. They also pointed out that developers must share information to be aware of impact of code change and resulting conflicts.

Guo [@Guo2015] developed a system for code execution state visualization for online tutoring.

[@Steinmacher2013] provided a review of awareness support in distributed software development.

### Collaborative data editing
Fechner et al. [@Fechner2015] explored possibility of synchronous collaborative mapping.

To support the task of collaborative information analysis, we are supporting two aspects: structured analytic techniques and activity awareness.


### Collaborative ideation
Siangliulue et al. [@Siangliulue2015a] explored a new scalable crowd-powered method for collaborative ideation. This is similar to collective deliberation, in which participants must share information and identify similarity and dissimilarity among user-generated information.

### Collaborative information seeking

Collaborative information seeking refers to the activity that participants work together to retrieve information to satisfy information needs. Awareness typically includes shared queries, result bookmarks, and page visitation history [@Kelly2014, @Shah2014]



## The task of information analysis

Information analysis consists two critical components: decomposition and externalization [@heuer1999psychology]. Decomposition is to break down the big problem into smaller components. Externalization is to get the issue out from your mind and into some form on a paper or a computer screen.

If a problem has smaller parts, these parts must also relate to each other in some way; that is the structure of the problem. The biggest difference of **analyzing** a problem from casually looking at a problem is how you structure a problem. A successful information analysis approach requires decomposition of the structure of the problem, and then externalize the structure.

Top ten needs for intelligence analysis tools [@Badalamente2005]

[@Scholtz2014] summarized guidelines for collaborative software for intelligence analysis by reviewing existing work. They emphasized the importance of user-centered design.

[@Rossy2014] mentioned the role of visualization in intelligence analysis, particularly in four aspects: temporal, spatial, relational, and quantitative.

[@Martin2014] overviewed the current training approaches in intelligence analysis. He called for change of teaching method in the new context of

## Process loss
Despite the potential benefits of collaborative work for complex tasks, teams could fail or not perform effectively because of *social process losses*. The loss could be due to *motivation loss*, including *social loafing*, *sucker effects* and *evaluation apprehension* that cause team members to work less hard in teams than as individuals. Teams can also experience losses in coordination, including production blocking (individuals cannot contribute simultaneously), and though derailment (group discussion interferes with one's ability to start or continue a train of thought).

## Activity Theory
[@Clemmensen2016] made a comprehensive review of activity theory in HCI research.

Activity theory originated from the Russian psychologist Alexey Leontiev (1978, 1981). A central claim is that it is activity that places the subjects in objective reality and transforms the reality into a form of subjectivity (Leontiev 1978). The human mind emerges, exists and develops within the context of human activity as a whole, and therefore analysis of object-oriented activities should be considered a necessary prerequisite for understanding the human mind.

Then Yrjo Engestrom (1987, 1999) extended the notion of activity to collective activities and organizational practices by adding a third component (in addition to subject-object), community.

In the late 1980-early 1990s, activity theory was introduced to HCI. For example, Susanne Bodker (1989, 1991), Nardi (1996).

Key citations: Nardi (1996), Engestrom (1987) and Bodker (1991). They are often cited as introduction to activity theory's history, key concepts and how to apply the theory.

Researchers have applied Activity Theory for both design and empirical data analysis, mostly using the concept of tool mediation (e.g. Parkman and Waern [@Parkman2008] studied collaborative writing tools; Bodker and Petersen [@Bodker2007] studied configuration of artifacts in media production; Oviatt et al. [@Oviatt2012] studied tools for learning activities), context (e.g. Barthelmess and Anderson [@Barthelmess2002] studied context of software development), and contradiction, tensions, and breakdown (e.g. Miettinen and Hasu [@Miettinen2002] studied contradictions in a network of activity systems related to innovation; Law and Sun [@Law2012] studied breakdowns in video games) [@Clemmensen2016].

Distributed cognition vs activity theory [@Arias-Hernandez2012]

[@MacEachren2015] discussed the role of visualization in sensemaking from theoretical perspective of distributed cognition
