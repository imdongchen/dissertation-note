# Empirical study

Empirical studies can be explanatory or descriptive. Explanatory papers describe experiments that support or falsify some hypotheses, mostly about a set of innovative design features. Theses works usually start with a set of hypotheses, and validate hypotheses by comparing exprimental groups and control groups. Descriptive studies are observations of workplace practices. These works usually describe collaboration behavior without any specific technical support, with state-of-the-art techniques, or with introduction of a new technology in organizataions/teams. Theses wroks aim to propose design implications for future improvement.


## Explanatory

Marlow and Dabbish [@Marlow2015] studied the effect of visualization of details of activity history on peer attitude

Goyal and Fussell [@Goyal2016] studied the effect of awareness of hypothesis development (which they named sensemaking transluence).

Goyal et al. [@Goyal2014] studied the effect of implicit sharing of hypotheses on team performance, perceived usefulness and cognitive load, and found that implicit sharing improved clue recall.

Goyal et al. [@Goyal2013] studied the effect of visualization and note-taking on group sensemaking performance.

Andre [@Andre2014] studied the effect of coordination strategies, specifically, sequential work structure and simultaneous work structure, on team performance in the context of online collaborative writing. Results indicate that sequential work structure is more effective than simultaneous work structure when group size increases; territoriality (feeling uncomfortable editing other people's work) accounts for the effect; and assigning roles explicitly reduces the effect.

Kang et al. [@Kang2014] studied the effect of *teammate inaccuracy blindness* on team performances

Mahyar and Tory [@Mahyar2013] studied how the feature of revealing connections between collaborators' findings supported team performance and awareness.

[@Hajizadeh2013] explored the effect of visualizing collaborator's brushing action on awareness support.

[@Gergle2013] proved that shared visualization improved situation awareness and conversational grounding with three lab experiments.

## Descriptive

Blomkvist et al. [@Blomkvist2015] described the communication between UX researchers and software developers in a distributed agile project from the perspective of **boundary objects**.

Borge and Carroll [@Borge2014, @Borge2012] reported a microanalysis of team communication patterns and contents when teams were recruited to solve a complex task and suggested that cognitive specialization be a more critical factor than verbal equity in affecting team performance. Carroll et al. [@Carroll2013] also analyzed the visual artifacts participants spontaneously created during the task and proposed a set of design implications for visualization support.

Gotz [@Gotz2006] conducted an observation study and examined analyst behavior in a 3-hour session. A critical result was that information gathering and result processing were tightly coupled into a single iterative stage.
