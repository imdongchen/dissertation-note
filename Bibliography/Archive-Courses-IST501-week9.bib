annote = {The paper focuses on web interface design to improve trust in the context of e-commerce. 
        
Before that, the paper reviews the nature and concepts of trust, from the disciplines of philosophy, psychology, management, and marketing, and summarize the characteristics of trust shared by all disciplines.
        
Then the paper puts forward the characteristics of online trust, and reviews the elements of online trust studied by existing research
        
Finally, the paper summarizes the framework trust-inducing features of web interface design, mainly in four dimensions: graphic design, structure design, content design, and social-cue design. An example is given to illustrate the four categories of features.},

@article{Anderson2006c,
abstract = {The economics of information security has recently become a thriving and fast-moving discipline. As distributed systems are assembled from machines belonging to principals with divergent interests, we find that incentives are becoming as important as technical design in achieving dependability. The new field provides valuable insights not just into "security" topics (such as bugs, spam, phishing, and law enforcement strategy) but into more general areas such as the design of peer-to-peer systems, the optimal balance of effort by programmers and testers, why privacy gets eroded, and the politics of digital rights management.},
