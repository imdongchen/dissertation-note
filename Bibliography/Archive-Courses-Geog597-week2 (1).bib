abstract = {As data sources become larger and more complex, the ability to effectively explore and analyze patterns among varying sources becomes a critical bottleneck in analytic reasoning. Incoming data contain multiple variables, high signal-to-noise ratio, and a degree of uncertainty, all of which hinder exploration, hypothesis generation/exploration, and decision making. To facilitate the exploration of such data, advanced tool sets are needed that allow the user to interact with their data in a visual environment that provides direct analytic capability for finding data aberrations or hotspots. In this paper, we present a suite of tools designed to facilitate the exploration of spatiotemporal data sets. Our system allows users to search for hotspots in both space and time, combining linked views and interactive filtering to provide users with contextual information about their data and allow the user to develop and explore their hypotheses. Statistical data models and alert detection algorithms are provided to help draw user attention to critical areas. Demographic filtering can then be further applied as hypotheses generated become fine tuned. This paper demonstrates the use of such tools on multiple geospatiotemporal data sets.},
annote = {There are two views in the system: geospatial view and time series, and the two views are linked. Early alert detection technique is used to find data aberration or hotspots.
        
Data aggregation and privacy preservation: On a base of actual location data overlays a layer represented as circles whose size stands for the size of a cluster and color stands for the percent of events.
        
Multivariate: as many as 3 variablees(3D mode)
        
Time: 
1. View historical data in "aggregate" and "increment" mode 
2. Temporal contours overlaid on spatial heatmap to explore trends.
        
Spae: To model the event distribution across the entire area, geospatial heatmap is produced using "kernel density estimation", rather than spatial histogram.
        
Attr: demographic and category filtering
        
        
        
This Visual Analytic system features:
1. Display georeferenced data events on a map and allow users to temporally scroll through data
2. Three graphs on the right show "a variety of data sources for a quick comparison of trends" (time series?)
3. Temporal control
4. Data aggregation and privacy preservation
5. Heatmap. Kernel density estimation
6. Context through color exploration
7. Time series analysis
8. Temporal contours},

annote = {The paper attempts to convey that visual analytics requires both human cognition and computational power, by analyzing three types of movement data: 1) single entity movements, 2) movements of multiple unrelated entities, and 3) movements of multiple related entities.

In single entity movement, "significant places" are decided by the amount of time spent at a place and clustering them. Then trips, described by sequences of recorded positions between the stops, are clustered. By examining the time spent on different trips, it is found that there're two shopping malls along the trip.

Problems:
1. How to define the significance of a place?
2. How to define a trip? Maybe one just starts off from home and doesn't go to work.

In multiple unrelated entities movement, two cartographic visualization techniques are introduced to present the aggregated data: mosaic diagrams for cyclical patterns and directional bar diagrams for movements in different directions. But details about them are not covered here.

Trajectories are 1)defined with starts and ends, and presented by a matrix; and 2) cluster points in divided "small areas"

Problem:
1. The matrix lacks geospatial context
2. How to define small areas?},
