@article{Lawrence2000c,
annote = {Accessibility of Information on the web:
1. Incomplete. Search engines cover only a small fraction (42{\%}, experiment conducted in 1999) of whole pages on the web.
        
2. Delayed. Indexing of new or modified pages can take several months or longer, which delays or even prevents the visibility of emerging technology or high-quality information
        
3. Inequal. Sites with more links have a higher chance of being indexed, and sites with greater "popularity" ranks higher.
        
Those drawbacks of search engines limit the accessiblity of information. In other words, users are "framed" by the information search engines provide. 
        
However, as the huge amount of information on the web, there is little possibility, if not any, to have equal access to all. But it is important that the biasment is made for you, not the search engines. Search engines should "learn" your preferences by recording your queries and selections. In addition, the preferences of your circles (friends, followings, etc.) can also be accounted. },

@article{Reddy2008c,
annote = {This paper focuses on Collaborative Information Behavior (CIB) and discusses the differences from Individual Information Behavior (IIB).
        
The paper puts forward a CIB model, viewing the information environment from two axes:1)Behavior axis; 2) Context axis. Behavior includes information searching and seeking (I wonder the difference), and context ranges from individual to collaborative.Also, the paper identifies some "triggers" that cause the shift from IIB to CIB.  
        
The method adopted in this paper is to study two patient care teams and identifies how they communicate and collaborate.
        
To understand CIB, we have to develop both a better conceptual understanding and system.And a good CIB system should include the four features: 1)Awareness 2)Chat 3)Conferencing 4)Visualization.
        
The paper introduces a prototype "MUSE", that has the chat, search and share function. Though the system provides certain support to collaboration, the function is obviously limited. For instance, no conferencing is supported. That means only two people are allowed, thus no awareness is introduced. The information is shared "blindly", with no idea who is really interested in it. 
        
Besides, the CIB model is too simple. Can it truly reflect the collaboration in real life?},

annote = {The authos talk about how humans perceive and process information, which is highly dependent on prior schemata and mental models.  
        
Judgements can be make wrong when 1)mental models are wrong; 2) mental models don't fit the current context.
        
Conscious thinking is based on several basic, subconscious levels of information management processing. Many errors originate from basic features of information processing: cognitive economy, protection of the feeling of competence; and the avoidance of ambiguity (giving structure and order to the world, to make the reality in consistent with mental models).
        
Information gathering problems: selective search for confirming information (confirmation bias), distortion of information, the suppression of unwanted information, and reduced acquisition of information},
