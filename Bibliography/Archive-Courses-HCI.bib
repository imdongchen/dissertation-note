@inproceedings{Madsen1994b,
abstract = {This paper follows a progmatic approach (the other two approaches are operational and structural approaches as identified by Carroll etc[5]) to introduce metaphor in the design process, or metaphorical design. The author first reviews five examples of use of metaphors, which serve as the empirical basis. Then the author derives theoretical guidelines to using metaphors in design. Guidelines are categorized into three main activities in the design process: generating metaphors, evaluating metaphors, and developing metaphors. Finally, a set of conceptual characteristics of metaphors in design are provided. To conclude, the paper introuduces the use of metaphors in design, how to use them, and how they work.},

abstract = {The paper introduces the framework of contextual design, which functions as a guideline for a cross-functional team to design a system based on user needs. Data collected from user interview is the base criterion for deciding the system design. The framework consists of several processes: 1. talk to specific customers while they work 2. interpret the data in a cross-functional team 3. consolidate data across multiple customers 4. invent solutions grounded in user work practice 5. structure the system to support this new work practice 6. interaction with customer through paper mockups 7. design the implementation object model or code structure},
