@article{Wilson2000c,
annote = {This paper reviews the origin and trend of the field of human information behavior. To begin with, it explains four terms:
1. Information Behavior
2. Information Seeking Behavior
3. Information Searching Behavior
4. Information User Behavior
        
The paper focuses on the trend of information seeking behavior:
1. 1948-{\~{}}1965, document-focused (libraries)
2. 1970s, exploration of information needs
3. Since 1980s, person centered, quantitative method to qualitative method
        
A new model proposed by Wilson 1996 interpret information behavior as problem-solving model. It perceives information seeking, searching and use as problem recognition, definition, solution, and statement.},
