@article{Carroll2011d,
abstract = {Although ths paper is composed for virtual organization, which has some special characteristics, most theories it mentions can be applied to general collaboration. The paper lists 24 facets of organizational effectiveness which are categorized into three high-level arenas of organizational function - awareness, problem solving, and sense of community. In detail, the paper talks about common ground and collective efficacy, inclusive problems solving, commitment and identification, and constructive dissent and conflict. The paper also addresses practice-based theory and patterns-based theory, which is unclear to me. Finally the paper reviews two projects in terms of patterns of effective VOs. To me, the greatest value of the paper is the description of some concepts, such as common ground, sense of community, and pattern.},

@article{Abelson2003a,
abstract = {A common thread weaving through the current public participation debate is the need for new approaches that emphasize two-way interaction between decision makers and the public as well as deliberation among participants. Increasingly complex decision making processes require a more informed citizenry that has weighed the evidence on the issue, discussed and debated potential decision options and arrived at a mutually agreed upon decision or at least one by which all parties can abide. We explore the recent fascination with deliberative methods for public involvement first by examining their origins within democratic theory, and then by focusing on the experiences with deliberative methods within the health sector. In doing so, we answer the following questions "What are deliberative methods and why have they become so popular? What are their potential contributions to the health sector?" We use this critical review of the literature as the basis for developing general principles that can be used to guide the design and evaluation of public involvement processes for the health-care sector in particular.},

First, the paper lists three conclusions from research of many held deliberations: 1. people are willing to discuss public issues and can sustain serious, in-depth conversations about technical and highly divisive matters. 2. People like deliberation when well organized 3. The products of deliberations are often excellent. Each point is supported by one or more empirical instances. Then the paper points out four limitation in current deliberative practice. 1. deliberation does not generate a full consensus (which is natural to me) 2. Good deliberation needs careful organization and facilitation 3. Deliberation must scale out to include many more participants to become politically and socially important, and scale up to address issues of state, national, and even international concern. 4. Deliberation needs a closer link to action.},

abstract = {This paper tries to answer two questions: 1. what types of stories do deliberative group members tell when they are engaged in disagreement? 2. How are individual and collective identities displayed in the stories and responses to them? The data used is an online deliberative forum where over 4000 New Yorkers engaged in 2 weeks of online discussion about what should be done with the site of the former World Trade Center. The analytic method used is "informed" by the tradition of narrative discourse analysis. The authors identified four types of stories told during the periods of difference: adversarial argument stories, which assume that individuals have conflicting interests in the issue; unitary argument stories, which assumes some level of commonality among group members; introduction stories, which occur during the earliest discussion thread and demonstrat the teller's connection to the issue; transformation stories, which include vivid emotional language and center on personal or social change. In a word, the study shows that storytelling can provide information, clarify values, encourage a sense of collective identity, and even provide group members with a vision of how the future could be.},

@article{Putnam1995c,
abstract = {The paper first discusses the significance of civic engagement, that it powerfully influences the quality of public life and performance of social institutions. Then it discusses the concept of "social capital", which refers to features of social organizations such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit, and how social capital could improve the performance of community. Then the paper lists some statistics showing the declining of civic engagement from 1970s to 1990s. However, as this paper was written in 1995, the evidence it refers is not so convincing any longer. The paper starts from research findings of decline of community and addresses the importance of community and explains why it's concerned with deliberation. The paper aims to address the question: how does deliberative civic engagement contribute to communty capacity building? First the author explains the concept of community and community capacity, and employs the community capacity-building framework by Robert Chaskin. The framework identifies four component characteristics of community capacity: 1) a sense of community, 2) commitment to community among its members, 3) the ability to solve problems, 4) access to resources, as well as four specific strategies for building community capacity: 1) leadership development, 2) organizational development, 3) community organizing, and 4) organizational collaboration. Then the paper argues how deliberation could contribute to these aspects of community capacity building by listing empirical evidence. In the end, the paper admits that although there is evidence that deliberation does have a positive effect on communities, what exactly makes these effects happen remains unclear.},

annote = {Some ideas in this paper:
1. There is too much GDSS, and not enough C, which means we used to overemphasized individual cognition and expert-group usability issues but less collaboration.
2. PPGIS emphasizes access to justice of disadvantaged populations and mostly on local scales
3. Distributional justice is unattainable. Systems with that goal fail. Instead, spatial justice can be maximized by procedural justice and access to justice.
4. A C-GDSS framework termed SPI is developed, which aims to {\&}{\#}039;use geovisual and geospatial methods to allow a more faithful inclusion of the cultural and social values of large numbers of public participants with diverse opinions into public good allocation{\&}{\#}039;.
5. Structured public involvement: speicified aim, form, method, content of public involvement.Experts{\&}{\#}039; input should be respected while only community know their cultural, spatial, and social preferences.Public input should be generated and documented prior to the initiation of the process of making plans.To increase spatial justice by integrating geovisual and geospatial tools into dialogic epistemology.
6.There exists a disparity between perceived and desired degree of participation in terms of Arnstein{\&}{\#}039;s ladder of citizen participation, which is termed {\&}{\#}039;Arnstein Gap{\&}{\#}039;. 
7. Geographic view of public involvement
7.1 develop an understanding of how people realize themselves in place. What values do citizens have and how are these values connected with the local landscape.
7.2 how geospatial and geovisual technologies function as dialogic elements in the communication between experts and public about visual and spatial preferences and cultural values that reflect citizen{\&}{\#}039;s relationship with landscape.

First the paper discusses the nature of community groups and their significance philosophically, practically, and politically. To describe the use of maps in community, the paper categorizes it into four types. The authors cite Zander in describing the basic steps a community usually takes to address a problem: describe a problem, identifiy possible actions, pick the best action, and take the chosen action. The authors name GIS used in the first two steps "strategic", and GIS in the last two steps "tactical". In addition, GIS is also used for administrative (display detailed local information to community staff) and organizing (involve and direct residents in participation). Finally the paper points out that GIS should also be used in different ways to different audiences.},

@article{Ryfe2006a,
abstract = {Through a videotape analysis of five National Issues Forums, the author investigated the nature and role of narrative in small group deliberation. The author finds narrative is most frequent in deliberation. The author conceptualizes narrative, or storytelling, as a sequence of events organized in a way that has a beginning, middle, and an end. Storytelling is found to play an important role in overcoming two barriers of deliberation. First is the motivation to engage in deliberation. Deliberation is a disconcerting experience as it is quite different from everyday reasoning which is largely unconscious, unreflective, and unintentional. Storytelling helps participants establish an identity that places themselves in a particular relationship with the issue at hand, and this relationship may let participants feel accountable, high stake, and diverse, which are considered to be three elements that tend to motivate people to adopt a deliberative frame of mind by literature of deliberative democracy. The other barrier is a lack of knowledge. Storytelling puts the complex issue into the particulars of experience and concrete contexts, and makes the issue amenable to human understanding. Moreover, storytelling makes participants appear more sincere, trustworthy, and friendly by disclosing personal information, and thus making their claims more valid. Meanwhile, stories instill civility and friendliness into conversation in the situation of disagreement and conflict. Finally storytelling allows to build a sense of moral community without much explicit conflict or argument. In the end, the author also talks about the implication of storytelling for the way of facilitation because facilitation has an obvious impact on the nature, extent, and consequence of narrative.},

The program lasted for 11 years and involved over 6000 residents, out of a total population of nearly 200000. The program has proved to change the approach of the community to public issues. Conflict in daily interactions which could have escalated into violence were resolved civilly as residents recalled earlier discussions with people different from themselves.

Also, information about the policy issue should be credible, sufficient, accurate, and accessible to participants, and allows for enough time for them to absorb and discuss. For process, deliberation should be transparent and sincere. Participants have equal right to make voice and equal access to all voices. Reasoning should be based on relevant factual information. For outcome, there should be change in participants' opinion towards the policy issue, as well as opinions of other participants. They are more informed with the issue, and become more politically active. Also, they develop greater respect, tolence, and trust for other participants. Finally the deliberation fullfils its ultimate goal if tangible impact on policy decision is observed.},

The distinguished point of the paper is that it measures the quality of deliberation by "sophistication of reasoning." They believe that successful deliberation increases participants' factual knowledge as well as the organization of core concepts, leading to more sophisticated understanding of an issue. Thus the more sophisticated the text reveals, the higher quality the deliberation is. The hand-coded technique utilizes Stromer-Gallery's coding scheme and counts the number of verbal behaviors. The nlp technique measures the sophistication of reasoning based on co-occurrence of concepts. An interesting measure here is the reasoning sophistication, which is claimed to measure the quality of deliberation.},

While some argue that computer-mediated groups are less likely to reach consensus because they share less information and are put in the impersonal context, another possiblity is the lack of structure in online discusssion.

abstract = {The paper proposes a Deliberation Dialogue Framework to model the process of deliberation among computational entities (rather than among humans). The paper starts with clarification about the concept of 'deliberation' discussed in this context. The author distinguishes 'deliberation' from other forms of dialogue, such as information-seeking dialogue, inquiry dialogue, persuasion dialogue, and negotiation dialogue, in terms of the objective of the dialogue, the objective of participants, and the information the participants had available at commencement of the dialogue. Specifically the framework defines 8 processes in deliberation, 6 types of deliberative sentences, several activities (protocol) participants do in each process with various types of sentences.Finally the problem of commitment is emphasized, with the concept of commitment store to track the position and change of position upheld by participants. Assessment of the protocol is conducted in three ways: applied in human dialogue,measured agaist normative principles of deliberation, and outcome.},
annote = {Deliberation dialogues differ from other forms of dialogues in terms of the objectives of the dialogue, the objectives of participants, and the information participants had at hand at commencement of dialogues. Specifically,
1. Deliberation is different from information-seeking and inquiry dialogues because deliberation focuses on action. In constrast, the latter two aim to search for truth, in regardless of value assumptions (preference, interest, etc.)
2. Deliberation differ from negotiation in that the latter concerns the allocation of resources and avoids share of information.
3. Deliberation differ from persuasion because persuasion begins with at least one participant bearing an initially defined plan in mind and attempts to persuade other participants to agree to the plan. Instead, there is often no solution or plan at commencement of deliberation. Participants discuss, propose, reason and finally come up with a final decision.
        
        
The paper also adopts the concept of commitment store, which tracks the commitment of each participant. },

@article{Elwyn2010b,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In this article, we examine definitions of suggested approaches to measure the concept of good decisions, highlight the ways in which they converge, and explain why we have concerns about their emphasis on post-hoc estimations and post-decisional outcomes, their prescriptive concept of knowledge, and their lack of distinction between the process of deliberation, and the act of decision determination. BACKGROUND: There has been a steady trend to involve patients in decision making tasks in clinical practice, part of a shift away from paternalism towards the concept of informed choice. An increased understanding of the uncertainties that exist in medicine, arising from a weak evidence base and, in addition, the stochastic nature of outcomes at the individual level, have contributed to shifting the responsibility for decision making from physicians to patients. This led to increasing use of decision support and communication methods, with the ultimate aim of improving decision making by patients. Interest has therefore developed in attempting to define good decision making and in the development of measurement approaches. METHOD: We pose and reflect whether decisions can be judged good or not, and, if so, how this goodness might be evaluated. RESULTS: We hypothesize that decisions cannot be measured by reference to their outcomes and offer an alternative means of assessment, which emphasizes the deliberation process rather than the decision's end results. We propose decision making comprises a pre-decisional process and an act of decision determination and consider how this model of decision making serves to develop a new approach to evaluating what constitutes a good decision making process. We proceed to offer an alternative, which parses decisions into the pre-decisional deliberation process, the act of determination and post-decisional outcomes. DISCUSSION: Evaluating the deliberation process, we propose, should comprise of a subjective sufficiency of knowledge, as well as emotional processing and affective forecasting of the alternatives. This should form the basis for a good act of determination.},

abstract = {The paper addresses a list of design choices for online deliberation, categorized into five highest-level questions: 1) Purpose. Should the purpose be to make final decisions or to generate innovative ideas (outcome)? Should the goal be an outcome of a group or individuals within the group (collectivity)? 2) Population. Should the recruitment of participants be random or selected (recuitment)? Should the whole process be public or private (audience)? 3) Spatiotemporal distance. Should deliberation occur in the same place (colocation)? Should deliberation allow asynchronous response (cotemporality)? 4) Communication medium. Should communication be speech, text, image or nultimodal (modality)? Should emotions be enabled or impeded (emotivity)? Should users' communication acts be transformed or left unaltered (fidelity)? 5) Deliberative process. Should deliberation be moderated or not, automatically or human-facilited (facilitation)? Should deliberation be structured to certain rules (structure)? should users be anonymous or identified (identifiability)? Should users be rewarded for contributing (incentivization)? Then the paper summarizes six metrics of good online deliberation: quantity (number of posts, participants, comments, etc.), quality (number of replies, length of replies, distribution of contributions from participants, interview user's feelings, grounding), inclusiveness (distribution of participants), preference (survey of deliberation rating), efficiency (time spent to accomplish a task), efficacy (whether or to which extent the deliberation accomplishes its purpose). Finally, the paper reviews literature and discusses what effects these design choices may lead to or are preferred based on temporary research achievements.},

abstract = {The most distinguished characteristics of deliberation the paper addresses is coherence. A common definition of "coherence" is that everyone receives every message, or full reception as the author named. However, this definition limits the scale of deliberation. Therefore, the author redefines coherence, by complete reach and complete consideration. The former means that anyone can send a message that is received by everyone, and the latter means that arguments are made after having heard everyone's considerations. The authors also discusses the benefits of both criteria from the perspectives of decision legitimacy and decision quality. By proposing the decision-structured deliberation model, the author augues that coherence could be achieved bseparately within each subdecision without participants receiving messages unrelated to it, thus reducing the negative effects of limits of memory and group processes.********** ********* The paper argues for large-scale deliberation and proposes a decision structure model to solve the problem in large-scale model. The paper starts with the characteristics of coherence of deliberation. A common definition of coherence is full reception, meaning that everyone is supposed to receive every message. However, in practice, deliberation often can't meet the requirement of full reception in terms of complete reach and complete consideration for several reasons.
