abstract = {In a world of widespread information access, information can overwhelm collaborators, even with visualizations to help. We extend prior work to study the effect of shared information on collaboration. We analyzed the success and discussion process of remote pairs trying to identify a serial killer in multiple crime cases. Each partner had half of the evidence, or each partner had all the available evidence. Pairs also used one of three tools: spreadsheet only (control condition), unshared visualizations, or shared visualization. Visualizations improved analysis over the control condition but this improvement depended on how much evidence each partner had. When each partner possessed all the evidence with visualizations, discussion flagged and pairs showed evidence of more confirmation bias. They discussed fewer hypotheses and persisted on the wrong hypothesis. We discuss the possible reasons for this phenomenon and implications for design of remote collaboration systems to incorporate awareness of intermediate processes important to collaborative success.},

@article{Salmon2006c,
abstract = {The construct of situation awareness (SA) has become a core theme within the human factors (HF) research community. Consequently, there have been numerous attempts to develop reliable and valid measures of SA but there is a lack of techniques developed specifically for the assessment of SA in command, control, communication, computers and intelligence (C4i) environments. During the design, development and evaluation of novel systems, technology and procedures, valid and reliable situation awareness measurement techniques are required for the assessment of individual and team SA, in order to determine the improvements (or in some cases decrements) resulting from proposed design and technological interventions. The paper presents a review of existing situation awareness measurement techniques for their suitability for use in the assessment of SA in C4i environments. Seventeen SA measures were evaluated against a set of HF methods criteria. It was concluded that current SA measurement techniques are inadequate by themselves for use in the assessment of SA in C4i environments, and a multiple-measure approach utilising different approaches is recommended.},

In the literature review part, the paper discusses collaboration vs. individual, public vs. private workspace, and sense-making theory, followed by discussion about activity awareness. Then the paper discusses about information visualization, and specifically, geo-visualization with map as centric. Next the paper lists seven design rational based on previous field study. In part four, the paper briefly explains the structure of the system and human evaluation. The second piece of work is a modification based on previous work and change to java-based prototype to web-based, and the paper discribes another set of evaluation. In the discussion part, the paper summarizes four design guidelines for geo-collaborative systems.},

abstract = {Decentralized command and control settings like those found in the military are rife with complexity and change. These settings typically involve dozens, if not hundreds to thousands, of heterogeneous players coordinating in a distributed fashion in a dynamically networked battlefield laden with sensor data, intelligence reports, communications, and plans emanating from many different perspectives. Consider the concept of team situation awareness in this setting. What does it mean for a team to be aware of a situation or, more importantly, of a critical change in a situation? Is it sufficient or necessary for all individuals on the team to be independently aware? Or is there some more holistic awareness that emerges as team members interact? We re-examine the concept of team situation awareness in decentralized systems beyond an individual-oriented knowledge-based construct by considering it as a team interaction-based phenomenon. A theoretical framework for a process-based measure called 'coordinated awareness of situations by teams' is outlined.},

@inproceedings{Schmidt2002,
abstract = {The paper discusses the definition of awaareness in CSCW. The term "awareness" is found ambiguous and has been used in various ways. For instance, awareness was initially adopted to denote practices through which cooperative activities are tacitly and unobtrusively aligned and integrated, but are now sometimes used to conceptualize the use of instant messaging system. The term is also often used with different adjectives, e.g. "general awareness", "collaborative awareness" "peripheral awareness" "background awareness" "passive awareness" "reciprocal awareness" "mutual awareness" "workspace awareness", etc. The first question to address with is of what cooperative actors are supposedly aware, or aware of what? The paper summarizes that it is aware of social context, and may lead to "informal interaction" and "a shared culture". Awareness is also used to denote those practices through which actors tacitly and seamlessly align and integrate their distributed and yet interdependent activities. The paper also distinguishes the difference between awareness and attention, or focus. Awareness is gathered "passively", while other workplace activities progress. Finally the paper talks about how awareness is gained so effortlessly without interrupting the current line of work. On the one hand, actors "monitor" the activities of their colleagues in the setting which doesn't require a response from them. On the other hand, actors display their activities that might be relevant to their colleagues. Besides, actors can gain awareness effortless because the world is "meaningful" to them.},
annote = {The term ‘awareness' here denotes taking heed of unfolding events and of possibly unfolding events; of things being done, of things done, and of things in need of being done; of developments within the joint effort that may be advantageous, detrimental, hazardous, etc. for one's own work; of occurrences that makes one's own work more urgent or less so, that require action or inaction, that necessitate changes to the intended course of action, etc. – all of it directly motivated by the actors' being interdependent in their work and hence by the unavoidable requirements of coordinating and integrating their various actions.},

We report here that this flow rate enhancement (over two orders) breaks down with the presence of chemical functionalization and relaxation of the nanoconfinement in graphene oxides. Molecular dynamics simulation results show that hydrodynamics applies in this circumstance, even at length scales down to nanometers. However, corrections on the slip boundary condition and viscosity of nanoconfined flow must be included to make quantitative predictions. These results were discussed with structural characteristics of the liquid water and hydrogen bond networks.},

abstract = {The social relations model (SRM) is a conceptual, methodological, and analytical approach that is widely used to examine dyadic behaviors and interpersonal perception within groups. This article introduces a general and flexible approach to estimating the parameters of the SRM that is based on Bayesian methods using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The Bayesian approach overcomes several statistical problems that have plagued SRM researchers. First, it provides a single unified approach to estimating SRM parameters that can be easily extended to more specialized models (e.g., measurement models, moderator variables, categorical outcome variables). Second, sampling-based Bayesian methods allow statistically reliable inferences to be made about variance components and correlations, even with small sample sizes. Third, the Bayesian approach is able to handle designs with missing data. In a simulation study, the statistical properties (bias, root-mean-square error, coverage rate) of the parameter estimates produced by the Bayesian approach are compared with those of the method of moment estimates that have been used in previous research. A data example is presented to illustrate how discrete person moderators can be included in SRM analyses using the Bayesian approach. Finally, further extensions of the SRM are discussed, and suggestions for applied research are made.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to propose foundations for a theory of situation awareness based on the analysis of interactions between agents (i.e. both human and non-human) in subsystems. This approach may help to promote a better understanding of technology-mediated interaction in systems, as well as helping in the formulation of hypotheses and predictions concerning distributed situation awareness. It is proposed that agents within a system each hold their own situation awareness, which may be very different from (although compatible with) that of other agents. It is argued that we should not always hope for, or indeed want, sharing of this awareness, as different system agents have different purposes. This view marks situation awareness as a dynamic and collaborative process binding agents together on tasks on a moment-by-moment basis. Implications of this viewpoint for the development of a new theory of, and accompanying methodology for, distributed situation awareness are offered.},

annote = {Critique the notion of knowledge in common in shared mental model. On one hand, the model dismisses the possibility of complementary knowledge--a participant does not need to know knowledge in other members, but knows what others know, the so-called ‘transactive memory'. On the other hand, shared mental model is static, while group mental model keeps evolving as communication and interaction proceed. It is more important to know how collaborators identify knowledge in common and use knowledge to coordinate their activities. 
In p. 25 the paper explains the notion of ‘activity awareness'. The goal is to shift the focus on static shared concepts (knowledge) to dynamic shared activity. The term ‘activity' takes from Activity Theory, which puts human behavior in an organized and contextualized framework.
The paper discusses four facets of activity awareness: common ground (Clark, 1996), community of practice (Wenger et al. 2002), social capital (Coleman, 1988), and human development (Vygotsky, 1978). It uses a hypothetical emergency management scenario (forest fire fighters).
Finally, the paper lists examples of design implications. One principle is that activity awareness should be supported with no extra attention and effort.},

These mechanisms penalise information providers, presuppose relevance to the recipient, and make access difficult. We discuss a study of shared editor use which suggests that awareness information provided and exploited through the shared workspace, smoothly between close and loose collaboration, passively allows users to move and to assign and coordinate work dynamically. Passive awareness mechanisms promise effective support for collaboration requiring this sort of behaviour, whilst avoiding problems with active approaches.},

The problem domain is narrowed to task planning within a small team under critical condition within a dynamic environment. Three interactions between the fields of CSCW and multiple view system design is discussed: 1. role. Team members have different qualification and responsibility and how do multiple views and toolsets account for these role differentiation? 2. distinction between private and public spaces of work. 3. Cognitive resources. Finally the paper proposes that sharing strategic information is more critical than declarative and procedural information, and should be shared implicitly. However, these claims are from theoretical summary, rather than empirical evidence.},

Inspired by the current zeitgeist in cognitive science, as well as by empirical data and pragmatic concerns, we offer an alternative theory of team cognition. Interactive Team Cognition (ITC) theory posits that (1) team cognition is an activity, not a property or a product; (2) team cognition should be measured and studied at the team level; and (3) team cognition is inextricably tied to context. There are implications of ITC for theory building, modeling, measurement, and applications that make teams more effective performers.},

The emphasis is on a type of quantitative inquiry called school effects research. It describes a methodology that is most appropriate for conducting studies of school effects in particular and educational contexts in general: hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). Two previously published studies are used as heuristic examples of school effects studies conducted with HLM methods. Both studies use large and nationally representative longitudinal data from the National Education Longitudinal study of 1988 to explore school effects on learning and its social distribution by student socioeconomic status. Study 1 focuses on the effects of high school size on learning. Study 2 focuses on how teachers' attitudes, taken as a collective property of the social organization of schools, influence both learning and its social distribution. Implications for both policy and research are discussed. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.},

However, it is still difficult to build groupware that supports group awareness. To address this problem, we have developed the Multi-User Awareness UI toolkit (MAUI) toolkit, a Java toolkit with a broad suite of awareness-enhanced UI components. The toolkit contains both extensions of standard Swing widgets, and groupware-specific components such as telepointers. All components have added functionality for collecting, distributing, and visualizing group awareness information. The toolkit packages components as JavaBeans, allowing wide code reuse, easy integration with IDEs, and drag-and-drop creation of working group-aware interfaces. The toolkit provides the first ever set of UI widgets that are truly collaboration-aware, and provides them in a way that greatly simplifies the construction and testing of rich groupware interfaces.},

We investigated users' space management strategies depending on the design philosophy of the user interface (visualization- or document-centric). We classified the types of territorial behavior exhibited in terms of how the users interacted with information on the display (integrated or independent workspaces). Next, we examined how territorial behavior impacted the common ground between the pairs of users.

Propose the discourse structure theory. The theory specifies three basic elements of a discourse structure: linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional structure.

Significance:
Distinction among linguistic structure, intention structure, and attention state is essestial to an explanation of interruptions, referring expressions, and cue phrases. It also helps to understand the relevance of various segments of discourse and the purposes of discourse participants},

@article{Begole1999,
abstract = {This article presents a critique of conventional collaboration transparency systems, also called “application-sharing” systems, which provide the real-time shared use of legacy single-user applications. We find that conventional collaboration transparency systems are inefficient in their use of network resources and lack support for key groupware principles: concurrent work, relaxed WYSIWIS, and group awareness. Next, we present an alternative approach to implementing collaboration transparency that provides many features previously seen only in collaboration-aware applicaitons. Our approach is based on a replicated architecture where selected single-user interface components are dynamically replaced by multiuser versions. The replacement occurs at run-time and is transparent to the single-user application and its developers.. As an instance of this approach, we describe its incorporation into a Java-based collaboration transparency system for serializable, Swing-based Java applications, called Flexible JAMM (Java Applets Made Multiuser). To validate that the flexible collaboration transparency system is truly an improvement over conventional systems, we conducted an empirical study of collaborators performing both tightly and loosely coupled tasks using Flexible JAMM versus a representative conventional collaboration transparency system, Microsoft NetMeeting. Completion times were significantly faster in the loosely coupled task using Flexible JAMM and were not adversely affected in the tightly coupled task. Accuracy was equivalent for both systems. Participants greatly preferred Flexible JAMM.},

We analyse activity theory in HCI since its first appearance about 25 years ago. Through an analysis and meta-synthesis of 109 selected HCI activity theory papers, we created a taxonomy of 5 different ways of using activity theory: (1) analysing unique features, principles, and problematic aspects of the theory; (2) identifying domain-specific requirements for new theoretical tools; (3) developing new conceptual accounts of issues in the field of HCI; (4) guiding and supporting empirical analyses of HCI phenomena; and (5) providing new design illustrations, claims, and guidelines. We conclude that HCI researchers are not only users of imported theory, but also theory-makers who adapt and develop theory for different purposes.},

@article{Grosz2006a,
abstract = {An adequate formulation of collective intentionality is crucial for understanding group activity and for modeling the mental state of participants in such activities. Although work on collective intentionality in philosophy, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science has many points of agreement, several key issues remain under debate. This paper argues that the dynamics of intention - in particular, the inter-related processes of plan-related group decision making and intention updating - play crucial roles in an explanation of collective intentionality. Furthermore, it is in these dynamic aspects that coordinated group activity differs most from individual activity. The paper specifies a model of the dynamics of agent intentions in the context of collaborative activity. Its integrated treatment of group decision making and coordinated updating of group-related intentions fills an important gap in prior accounts of collective intentionality, thus helping to resolve a long-standing debate about the nature of intentions in group activity. The paper also defines an architecture for collaboration-capable computer agents that satisfies the constraints of the model and is a natural extension of the standard architecture for resource-bounded agents operating as individuals. The new architecture is both more principled and more complete than prior architectures for collaborative multi-agent systems.},
