This paper reviews the definition of data, information, knowledge and wisdom, and gives his conclusion. The distinction between data and information, information and knowledge is analyzed. The transformation process from the low level in the hierarchy is said to be targeted, but little is touched. 
        
The paper also notices that limited discussion about wisdom is made in the reviewed texts.},

annote = {Deliberation refers to a form of public discourse where interested community and stakeholders communite to identify goals and explore solutions. And Geodeliberation adds spatial emphasis to traditional deliberation. Geodeliberation and spatial analysis are two different aspects of GIS and require different functions and systems. 

A conceptual model of deliberative dialogue is proposed, consisting of five phases

Geospatial annotations are used to represent and structure the artifacts of geodeliberation. 

Annotations are linked with geometry on map and other referential annotations. The linking of annotations through their references from directional trees (SpaceTree), which can be used for visualization by threads of deliberative dialogues around an issue. 

GeoDeliberator is built following GeoDAT. It is C/S architectured, with Ext JS and Openlayers as client, and ASP.NET as server, and PostGIS as database.

Problem: are annotations linked automatically?

It seems the only support of GIS in the deliberative dialogue is display of location. More spatial analysis?},

abstract = {Anticipatory standards such as Web service standards are artifacts ‘designed' by consortium-based standards development organizations. Intricate processes followed to develop anticipatory standards are not well-understood. Recently, the D-S-N model was developed to explain these processes, and suggested that these processes contain cycles of design (D), sense-making (S), and negotiation (N) activities. In this paper, we provide an initial report of a case study that empirically analyzes archival documents of SOAP standard development. Our findings reveal that the D-S-N model is applicable to the Web service standardization process followed at W3C but this model provides only partial explanation of the process, and that design and sense-making are the core activities of the process. Our findings also show that participants spent most of their time discussing technical issues and identifying action items to be performed, large organizations dominated the process, and negotiation is the least frequent activity.},

@article{Fricke2008c,
annote = {Critics about DIKW hierarchy:
1. There is information in the unobservable world while data should be observable. This indicates information doesn't necessarily rest on data, which conflicts with DIKW.
Argue: only data that has an influence on individuals should be perceived as information. If it is unobservable, even with instruments, what sense does this kind of "data" make?
        
2. Universal statements or statistical generalizations are beyond the observable, thus can't constitute information, while some statements are obviously information.
Argue: Data, and inference from data, can both contribute to information
        
3. If inductive or inference is permitted, data and information may be not true.
Argue: Inductive is permitted, but DIKW doesn't say all inductives are permitted. We can confine that only true inductives are data. 
        
4. Information in DIKW seeks questions without "why", which should obviously be considered in information seeking. 
Argue: 'why' is answered in knowledge.
        
5. DIKW encourage uninspired methodology, mindless and  meaningless collection of data.
        
6. Knowledge should not be taken as "know-how", but rather as "know-that"
        
        
Suggestions by the author:
1. Data: data is fallible, but data needs to be true. Data can be more than 'observable', and it includes contexts, conventions and pragmatics.
        
2. Information. Information need not be data. information is more extensive than data and logically stronger than data.
        
3. Knowledge. Knowledge should be 'know-that', rather than 'know-how'. It can also be called 'weak knowledge', which is actually the same with information
        
4. Wisdom. In alignment with DIKW. Using practical know-how to achieve appropriate ends.},

3. Inequal. Sites with more links have a higher chance of being indexed, and sites with greater "popularity" ranks higher.
        
Those drawbacks of search engines limit the accessiblity of information. In other words, users are "framed" by the information search engines provide. 
        
However, as the huge amount of information on the web, there is little possibility, if not any, to have equal access to all. But it is important that the biasment is made for you, not the search engines. Search engines should "learn" your preferences by recording your queries and selections.

The strength of classification is its ability to establish relationships between classees that are stable and meaningful. Weakness is that the rigidity of structure limits the communication between the user and computer. Context, questions and answers are fixed. 
        
The strength of categorization is its flexibility in context and provides for effective communication between user and system. The weakness is disability to establish meaningful relationships across time and contexts because categories are built by the individual.
        
（It reminds me of supervised classification and unsupervised classification in RS)
        
        
Categorization: Divide the world into groups in terms of similarities within a given context, which may vary. 
        
Classical theory of categories:
1. The internal structure is ungraded
2. Boundaries of categories are fixed and rigid.
3. Inheritance.
        
Objective views against classical theory of categories:
1. Inability to identify the defining characteristics of an entity
2. Evidence of graded structure. Observations exist that subjects do grade typicality of members and nonmenbers of a category.
3. Doubt on the existence of explicit inclusion / exclusion relationship between an entity and a category.
        
Classification:
Assign each entity to only one class orderly and systematcally based on a set of predetermined principles.
        
Taxonomic classification: stability criteria of each class facilitates transmission of knowledge across time and language.
        
Differences between classification and categorization:
Classification is exclusive and nonoverlapping based on a set of predetermined principles, the context and composition of which are stable. But categorization divides the world by experience according to similarities within a context which may vary across time.
        
Comparisons can be made in six aspects: process, boundaries, membership, criteria for assignment, typicality and structure
        
Ordering, grouping and organization
        
Classification is organization: there are meaningful relationships between constituent classes

annote = {This paper focuses on Collaborative Information Behavior (CIB) and discusses the differences from Individual Information Behavior (IIB).
        
The paper puts forward a CIB model, viewing the information environment from two axes:1)Behavior axis; 2) Context axis. Behavior includes information searching and seeking (I wonder the difference), and context ranges from individual to collaborative.Also, the paper identifies some "triggers" that cause the shift from IIB to CIB.  
        
The method adopted in this paper is to study two patient care teams and identifies how they communicate and collaborate.
        
To understand CIB, we have to develop both a better conceptual understanding and system.And a good CIB system should include the four features: 1)Awareness 2)Chat 3)Conferencing 4)Visualization.
        
The paper introduces a prototype "MUSE", that has the chat, search and share function. Though the system provides certain support to collaboration, the function is obviously limited. For instance, no conferencing is supported. That means only two people are allowed, thus no awareness is introduced. The information is shared "blindly", with no idea who is really interested in it. 
        
Besides, the CIB model is too simple. Can it truly reflect the collaboration in real life?},

And Geodeliberation adds spatial emphasis to traditional deliberation. Geodeliberation and spatial analysis are two different aspects of GIS and require different functions and systems. 
        
A conceptual model of deliberative dialogue is proposed, consisting of five phases
        
Geospatial annotations are used to represent and structure the artifacts of geodeliberation. 
        
Annotations are linked with geometry on map and other referential annotations. The linking of annotations through their references from directional trees (SpaceTree), which can be used for visualization by threads of deliberative dialogues around an issue. 
        
GeoDeliberator is built following GeoDAT. It is C/S architectured, with Ext JS and Openlayers as client, and ASP.NET as server, and PostGIS as database.
        
Problem: are annotations linked automatically?
        
It seems the only support of GIS in the deliberative dialogue is display of location. More spatial analysis?

In 1945 VAnnevar Bush published an article dealing with massive information. After World War II followed the a scientific and technical revolution which produced "information explosion" around 1963.Support from the government developed information science.
        
nature of "information" 
Learn the nature of information from its manifestations, behaviors and effects.Information can be viewed in three senses, in broader sequence:
        
Narrow: the property of a message which can be estimated by probability. Like uncertainty in information theory by Shannon.Adopted by system-oriented information science.
        
Broader: cognitive processing and understanding.
        
Broadest: not only messages and that cognitively processed, but also context(situation, task, problem). This sense is considered in information science.
        
        
Structure in terms of problems addressed
        
Two clusters: basic and applied clusters are there. 
The key problem to address is the interface between people and literature.
        
        
Evolutionary trends in IR
First proposed in 1951 by Calvin Mooers.The research is divided into two lines: system oriented and human-centered.
