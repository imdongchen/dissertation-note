@article{Convertino2005g,
abstract = {The paper discusses the design of multiple view in the context of CSCW, especially how multiple view approach can support common ground as discussed in Clark, which means mutual knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions that conversational partners share. The problem domain is narrowed to task planning within a small team under critical condition within a dynamic environment. Three interactions between the fields of CSCW and multiple view system design is discussed: 1. role. Team members have different qualification and responsibility and how do multiple views and toolsets account for these role differentiation? 2. distinction between private and public spaces of work. 3. Cognitive resources. Finally the paper proposes that sharing strategic information is more critical than declarative and procedural information, and should be shared implicitly. However, these claims are from theoretical summary, rather than empirical evidence.},

@article{Wu2013i,
abstract = {This paper reports two pieces of work, emphasizing the design process, taking the perspective from collaborative geospatial planning in emergency management. In the literature review part, the paper discusses collaboration vs. individual, public vs. private workspace, and sense-making theory, followed by discussion about activity awareness. Then the paper discusses about information visualization, and specifically, geo-visualization with map as centric. Next the paper lists seven design rational based on previous field study. In part four, the paper briefly explains the structure of the system and human evaluation. The second piece of work is a modification based on previous work and change to java-based prototype to web-based, and the paper discribes another set of evaluation. In the discussion part, the paper summarizes four design guidelines for geo-collaborative systems.},

@inproceedings{Balakrishnan2010e,
abstract = {In a world of widespread information access, information can overwhelm collaborators, even with visualizations to help. We extend prior work to study the effect of shared information on collaboration. We analyzed the success and discussion process of remote pairs trying to identify a serial killer in multiple crime cases. Each partner had half of the evidence, or each partner had all the available evidence. Pairs also used one of three tools: spreadsheet only (control condition), unshared visualizations, or shared visualization. Visualizations improved analysis over the control condition but this improvement depended on how much evidence each partner had. When each partner possessed all the evidence with visualizations, discussion flagged and pairs showed evidence of more confirmation bias. They discussed fewer hypotheses and persisted on the wrong hypothesis. We discuss the possible reasons for this phenomenon and implications for design of remote collaboration systems to incorporate awareness of intermediate processes important to collaborative success.},
