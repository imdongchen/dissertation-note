abstract = {There is an increasing awareness that the articulation of forensic science and criminal investigation is critical to the resolution of crimes. However, models and methods to support an effective collaboration between the partners are still poorly expressed or even lacking.Three propositions are borrowed from crime intelligence methods in order to bridge this gap: (a) the general intelligence process, (b) the analyses of investigative problems along principal perspectives: entities and their relationships, time and space, quantitative aspects and (c) visualisation methods as a mode of expression of a problem in these dimensions.Indeed, in a collaborative framework, different kinds of visualisations integrating forensic case data can play a central role for supporting decisions. Among them, link-charts are scrutinised for their abilities to structure and ease the analysis of a case by describing how relevant entities are connected. However, designing an informative chart that does not bias the reasoning process is not straightforward. Using visualisation as a catalyser for a collaborative approach integrating forensic data thus calls for better specifications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Forensic Science Society.},

abstract = {This paper explores the opportunities for the application of network analytic techniques to the problems of criminal intelligence analysis, paying particular attention to the identification of vulnerabilities in different types of criminal organization - from terrorist groups to narcotics supply networks. A variety of concepts from the network analysis literature are considered in terms of the promise they hold for helping law enforcement agencies extract useful information from existing collections of link data. For example, six different notions of "centrality" and the three major notions of "equivalence" are examined for their relevance in revealing the mechanics and vulnerabilities of criminal enterprises. ?? 1991.},

@techreport{Vision2015,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The Sandbox is a flexible and expressive thinking environment that supports both ad-hoc and more formal analytical tasks. It is the evidence marshalling and sense-making component for the analytical software environment called nSpace. This paper presents innovative Sandbox human information interaction capabilities and the rationale underlying them including direct observations of analysis work as well as structured interviews. Key capabilities for the Sandbox include "put-this-there" cognition, automatic process model templates, gestures for the fluid expression of thought, assertions with evidence and scalability mechanisms to support larger analysis tasks. The Sandbox integrates advanced computational linguistic functions using a Web Services interface and protocol. An independent third party evaluation experiment with the Sandbox has been completed. The experiment showed that analyst subjects using the Sandbox did higher quality analysis in less time than with standard tools. Usability test results indicated the analysts became proficient in using the Sandbox with three hours of training.},

abstract = {Collaborative visual analysis tools can enhance sensemak- ing by facilitating social interpretation and parallelization of effort. These systems enable distributed exploration and evidence gathering, allowing many users to pool their ef- fort as they discuss and analyze the data. We explore how adding lightweight tag and link structure to comments can aid this analysis process. We present CommentSpace, a col- laborative system in which analysts comment on visualiza- tions and websites and then use tags and links to organize findings and identify others' contributions. In a pair of stud- ies comparing CommentSpace to a system without support for tags and links, we find that a small, fixed vocabulary of tags (question, hypothesis, to-do) and links (evidence- for, evidence-against) helps analysts more consistently and accurately classify evidence and establish common ground. We also find that managing and incentivizing participation is important for analysts to progress from exploratory analysis to deeper analytical tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that tags and links can help teams complete evidence gathering and synthesis tasks and that organizing comments using tags and links improves analytic results.},

@article{Karvetski2013,
abstract = {Intelligence analysis often tackles questions shrouded by deep uncer- tainty, such as those that deal with chemical and biological terrorism or nuclear weapon detection. In dealing with such questions, the task falls on intelligence analysts to assemble collected items of information and determine the consistency of the body of reporting with a set of conflicting hypotheses. One popular procedure within the Intelligence Community for distinguishing a hypothesis that is ‘‘least inconsistent'' with evidence is analysis of competing hypotheses (ACH). Although ACH aims at reducing confirmation bias, as typically implemented, it can fall short in diagramming the relationships between hypotheses and items of evidence, determining where assumptions fit into the modeling framework, and providing a suitable model for ‘‘what-if'' sensitivity analysis. This paper describes a facilitated process that uses Bayesian networks to (1) provide a clear probabilistic character- ization of the uncertainty associated with competing hypotheses, and (2) prioritize information gathering among the remaining unknowns. We illustrate the process using the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in The Dalles, Oregon, USA.},
