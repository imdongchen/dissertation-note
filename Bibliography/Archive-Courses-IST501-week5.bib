annote = {Deliberation refers to a form of public discourse where interested community and stakeholders communite to identify goals and explore solutions. And Geodeliberation adds spatial emphasis to traditional deliberation. Geodeliberation and spatial analysis are two different aspects of GIS and require different functions and systems. 

A conceptual model of deliberative dialogue is proposed, consisting of five phases

Geospatial annotations are used to represent and structure the artifacts of geodeliberation. 

Annotations are linked with geometry on map and other referential annotations. The linking of annotations through their references from directional trees (SpaceTree), which can be used for visualization by threads of deliberative dialogues around an issue. 

GeoDeliberator is built following GeoDAT. It is C/S architectured, with Ext JS and Openlayers as client, and ASP.NET as server, and PostGIS as database.

Problem: are annotations linked automatically?

It seems the only support of GIS in the deliberative dialogue is display of location. More spatial analysis?},
