abstract = {An emerging trend in classroom technology research is the use of$\backslash$ncomputer mediated communication (CMC) tools in classrooms to$\backslash$nencourage students' in-class participation. As part of this research$\backslash$nthread, we have been investigating the potential of public digital$\backslash$nbackchannels for building feelings of community among students$\backslash$nin university courses. We designed, deployed and evaluated such$\backslash$na tool in a 15-week field study of two undergraduate classes. We$\backslash$nfound students found using public backchannel during the class is$\backslash$nof little distraction, that teachers' attention to the content posted$\backslash$non the channel influence students' tendency to use tools of this$\backslash$nkind. Further, we found that the relevance of the content shared is$\backslash$npredictive of students' use of ClasCommons in the classroom;$\backslash$nthese feelings in turn are related to students' perceptions of selfefficacy,$\backslash$ncollective efficacy and course-specific social support.$\backslash$nWe also analyzed the content posted in the public backchannel$\backslash$nand considered the benefits and drawbacks of the public digital$\backslash$nfrom both students' and teachers' perspectives. We conclude with$\backslash$nsuggestions for improving the design and deployment of courserelated$\backslash$nbackchannels.},

abstract = {Although ths paper is composed for virtual organization, which has some special characteristics, most theories it mentions can be applied to general collaboration. The paper lists 24 facets of organizational effectiveness which are categorized into three high-level arenas of organizational function - awareness, problem solving, and sense of community. In detail, the paper talks about common ground and collective efficacy, inclusive problems solving, commitment and identification, and constructive dissent and conflict. The paper also addresses practice-based theory and patterns-based theory, which is unclear to me. Finally the paper reviews two projects in terms of patterns of effective VOs. To me, the greatest value of the paper is the description of some concepts, such as common ground, sense of community, and pattern.},

abstract = {We build on our prior work with computer-supported teams performing a complex decision-making task on maps, where the distinction between content and process common ground is proposed. In this paper we describe a distributed geo-collaboration software prototype. The system design rationale was gleaned from fieldwork, literature on team cognition, and an earlier lab study introducing a reference task with face-to-face teams. We report on a controlled experiment that evaluates this design rationale. Distinct sets of measures show that that the prototype supported both content and process common ground, offsetting the costs imposed by the distributed setting. We interpret the results in relation to prior work on common ground and draw implications for moving beyond current models of sharing and coordination.},

annote = {Critique the notion of knowledge in common in shared mental model. On one hand, the model dismisses the possibility of complementary knowledge--a participant does not need to know knowledge in other members, but knows what others know, the so-called ‘transactive memory'. On the other hand, shared mental model is static, while group mental model keeps evolving as communication and interaction proceed. It is more important to know how collaborators identify knowledge in common and use knowledge to coordinate their activities. 
In p. 25 the paper explains the notion of ‘activity awareness'. The goal is to shift the focus on static shared concepts (knowledge) to dynamic shared activity. The term ‘activity' takes from Activity Theory, which puts human behavior in an organized and contextualized framework.
The paper discusses four facets of activity awareness: common ground (Clark, 1996), community of practice (Wenger et al. 2002), social capital (Coleman, 1988), and human development (Vygotsky, 1978). It uses a hypothetical emergency management scenario (forest fire fighters).
Finally, the paper lists examples of design implications. One principle is that activity awareness should be supported with no extra attention and effort.},

In previous work we have reported that activities like public real-time commenting on videos can enhance student participation and engagement. However, these events occur over a limited period of time. Thus a more challenging question is how to increase and sustain student engagement. In this paper we describe the iterative development of Class Commons, a public commenting system with which students can post questions/comments that are shared through a public display in the classroom. The system was used in a senior undergraduate class in the spring semester of 2009. Our findings suggest that students were interested in this system. Students with different self-construal (independent vs. interdependent) appropriate this system for slightly different purposes. In the long run, we speculate that by having the teacher involved more in using this system (responding more quickly, helping structuring the discussions), it has potential for promoting sustained student engagement.},

They use "community collective efficacy" to term the beliefs of collective capacities, as extended from self-efficacy by Bandura(1997). They regard CCE as a direct indicator of the quality of community, and as an indicator of a community's readiness to approach higher order challenges such as organizational learning and creativity. In the paper they discuss the community collective efficacy scale they designed to make capacity analysis of various communities. Communities they investigated vary from residential community in Blacksburg electronic village, to professional community / technical scientific community in Citeceer, to interest community / developmental learning community in university. The paper mostly talks about their design of community collective efficacy scale, and doesn't talk much about the concept of CCE, the significance of CCE, the result of their CCE survey, and how technology could enhance CCE.},
