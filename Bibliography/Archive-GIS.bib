annote = {This paper reviews nine web-based mobile tourism guides that are adaptive to context (context-awareness)

Comparison is made along two dimensions: context and adaption.

Context
1. scope. what contextual factors are considered?
2. representation. a) mechanisms for enhancing context reusability. b) level of abstraction at which context is represented.
3. acquisition. degree of automation: manual, automatic, or semi-automatic
4. mechanism. pull based or push-based

Adaptation
1. kind. what operations are done for adaption? e.g. filter content, change image resolution, interface change
2. subject. Level of the application to be adapted: content level, hyperbase level (navigation structure), presentation level (the layout of each page with user interaction facilities)
3. process},

abstract = {In user interface design a common pitfall is to use the technical properties of the device as basis for the design, which easily causes a user interface to become too complicated and hard to use. Also, the great development in the area of different hand-held terminal devices has set new requirements for user interfaces: screen sizes of devices are very small, advanced I/O devices are used instead of ordinary mouse and keyboard and the operating environment of the devices differs significantly from familiar PCs and laptops. However, governmental and in particular military communications systems often trail behind this development. To be able to overcome the aforementioned challenges and take usability of governmental communication systems to a new level, a new approach is needed. This paper covers user-centered design of graphical user interfaces to advanced communication devices designed to be used in challenging environment, e.g., in moving vehicles and outdoors in any season, and to support devices with limited screen size and touch screen technology. We also introduce a proof-of-concept implementation and show through a user test that general principles introduced in the paper can easily be applied to a specialized communication device.},

abstract = {As the development of internet and spatial information technology, clients' demands becoming more and more varied. However, as the service model of present map system is inflexible and fixed, it cannot adapt to diversified clients' demands, different types of devices and user scenarios. Intelligent map service takes adaptive geo-database as its data engine, provides effective, integrated and flexible data organization modes, automatically adjusts map content, map symbols, representation and data transfer mode, etc. Through multi-level storage and thematic data organizing, and analyzing user tasks and constantly changing scenarios, thus the system can serve the individualization and intellectualization of maps. Based on relative researches and the theory of adaptive system, intelligent map service and adaptive geo-database are introduced to form an intelligent map service platform which is self-adaptive, self-adjustive and self-organizational. It can automatically organize data, recommend information and provide intelligent map services, according to different users' requirements, map generation and application environment.},

abstract = {Significant interaction challenges arise in both developing and using interactive map applications. Users encounter problems of information overload in using interactive maps to complete tasks. This is further exacerbated by device limitations and interaction constraints in increasingly popular mobile platforms. Application developers must then address restrictions related to screen size and limited bandwidth in order to effectively display maps on mobile devices. In order to address issues of user information overload and application efficiency in interactive map applications, we have developed a novel approach for delivering personalized vector maps. Ongoing task interactions between users and maps are monitored and captured implicitly in order to infer individual and group preferences related to specific map feature content. Personalized interactive maps that contain spatial feature content tailored specifically to users' individual preferences are then generated. Our approach addresses spatial information overload by providing only the map information necessary and sufficient to suit user interaction preferences, thus simplifying the completion of tasks performed with interactive maps. In turn, tailoring map content to specific user preferences considerably reduces the size of vector data sets necessary to transmit and render maps on mobile devices. We have developed a geographic information system prototype, MAPPER (MAP PERsonalization), that implements our approach. Experimental evaluations show that the use of personalized maps helps users complete their tasks more efficiently and can reduce information overload.},

The paper describes three high-level strategies to simplify the organization of GIS functions: by implicit invocation, by removing the need to interact with low-level components of GIS representation, and by regarding analysis as a set of transformations of geodatabase. Finally, the paper suggests referring to some textbooks for the conceptualization of GIS functions.},

abstract = {This article discusses the challenges in computer systems research posed by the emerging field of pervasive computing. It first examines the relationship of this new field to its predecessors: distributed systems and mobile computing. It then identifies four new research thrusts: effective use of smart spaces, invisibility, localized scalability, and masking uneven conditioning. Next, it sketches a couple of hypothetical pervasive computing scenarios, and uses them to identify key capabilities missing from today's systems. The article closes with a discussion of the research necessary to develop these capabilities},

We consider multiple classes of adaptive multimedia services and assume the prioritization among classes in the bandwidth adaptation. A threshold-type call admission control algorithm is proposed and a product-form solution is derived. Also, we formulate a nonlinear programming model to find out threshold values for optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed method guarantees maximum revenue while satisfying the quality of service requirements},

abstract = {Mass customization requires acquisition of customer preferences, which can be modeled with multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). Unfortunately current methods of acquiring MAUT weights and utility functions require too many queries. In Iona, the user is first queried for absolute/preferred constraints and categorical preferences to cull the product pool. Next Iona selects queries to maximally reduce the utility uncertainty of the remaining product choices. Implemented queries include stereotype membership and contexts (the purchase situation), which give probabilistic MAUT data modeled as ranges of weights. The usefulness of a query is based on the reduction in uncertainty (smaller range) weighted by the likelihood that the user belongs to a stereotype/context based on similarity to the current user model. Querying proceeds until the usefulness of the best query is below the threshold of user impatience. Finally integer programming is used to select the best product for the user.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems have found their ways into many on-line web applications, e.g., product recommendation on Amazon and movie recommendation on Netflix. Particularly, collaborative filtering techniques have been widely used in these systems to personalize the recommendations according to the needs and tastes of users. In this paper, we apply collaborative filtering in spatial object recommendation which is essential in many location based services. Due to the large number of spatial objects and participating users, using collaborative filtering to obtain recommendations for a particular user can be very expensive. However, we observe that users tend to have affinity for some regions and argue that using users with similar regional bias in recommendation may help in reducing the search space of similar users. Thus, we propose two techniques, namely, Access Minimum Bounding Rectangle Overlapped Area (AMBROA) and Grid Division Cosine Similarity (GDCS), to form regions of interests that represent user location interests and activities and to find users with local access similarity to facilitate effective spatial object recommendation. We conduct an extensive performance evaluation to validate our ideas. Evaluation result demonstrates the superiority of our proposal over the conventional approach.},

This paper looks at the concept of relevance and its potential for and application to mobile cartography. First, theoretical concepts of relevance from other disciplines are studied followed by an analysis of different approaches for the assessment of relevance. A basic model for the determination of geographic relevance is postulated and the application modes of relevance to mobile cartography are elaborated. Two applications of relevance to mobile cartography are discussed with an emphasis on visualisation techniques for the presentation of relevance in maps. Some final remarks conclude the comments on relevance in mobile maps.},

Situated virtual characters can employ knowledge of their environment in reasoning about the goals or intentions of other characters, virtual or human, contributing to their believability. This paper presents lightweight techniques to that extent, utilizing object affordances and observed behavior of characters to define an observer reasoning about that behavior. In case an observer reasons about the behavior of virtual autonomous agents, knowledge of behavior-producing rules can also be employed. This is formalized by extending earlier work on mental state abduction of BDI-based agents with the techniques presented here. The presentation is technical, illustrated with practical examples.},

In this paper, we present Gulliver's Genie, an archetypical ubiquitous computing application. Gulliver's Genie embraces three central constructs; those of agency, mobility and adaptivity. The architecture adopts a Multi-Agent Systems metaphor whereby agents manage and maintain a context within which mobile users exist and, based upon this context, seeks to adapt and personalize content based upon perceived individual user needs. Agents are mobile and may migrate to or from environmental artifacts reflecting their computational constraints.},

Certainly this suggests a constraint on or a goal for design, but how do we go from such statements to actual designs that accomplish the stated goals?

abstract = {Geospatial information is a fundamental component of many crisis management activities. However, current geospatial technologies do not support work by crisis management personnel, most of whom are not technology specialists—a key impediment is that the technologies require the user to learn the system's language . In addition, geospatial technologies are not ‘collaboration friendly'—they impede rather than facilitate group work. In this paper we address both issues by presenting (1) a theoretical framework for understanding the roles of visual mediation in map-supported human – human dialogues, and (2) a computational approach for enabling such roles in collaborative spatial decisionmaking contexts. Building upon our initial implementation of a map-mediated collaborative environment, the DAVE{\_}G system [a natural, multimodal, dialogue-enabled interface to geographical information systems (GIS)], we model human – GIS and human – GIS – human dialogues as complex visual-cognitive signification processes in which maps become dynamic facilitators. Using a scenario simulating two crisis managers dealing with a major nuclear release event, we demonstrate how visual display (in DAVE{\_}G) actively mediates human – human dialogue directed to situation assessment and action planning in real applications.},

abstract = {Spatial cognitive abilities play an important role in the use of GIS, although they have yet to be examined in a controlled experimental setting. This study aimed to develop an experimental design which measures spatial cognitive abilities in the use of GIS, specifically the map overlay operation. Subjects (n = 134) received three map overlay tests in which they were given two of the following: input map layers, logical operator(s), or output map layer(s). Subjects were required to select the correct logical operator for Test 1, to select the correct output map layer for Test 2, and to select the correct input map layers for Test 3. Each test contained a total of 16 questions, based on a 4 (‘and', ‘or', ‘xor', ‘not' operators) × 2 (one or two polygons per map layer) × 2 (three or five polygon edges) factorial design. Results indicated a significant main effect of logical operators and number of polygons on performance; however, there was no effect of the number of polygon edges on performance. Significant two-way interactions revealed an effect of the number of polygon edges and the number of polygons using various logical operators on performance. In addition, performance was not significantly different between males and females or between GIS users and non-users. Overall, results show that map overlays in which a visual correspondence can be made between the same polygons in the input and output map layers are cognitively less demanding than map overlays in which the shape of the polygons have been radically transformed between the input and output map layers. This study helps further develop our understanding of the spatial cognitive abilities which are required in the use of GIS, and whether certain sub-populations differ in these cognitive abilities. These results may contribute to more effective and efficient GIS teaching and interface design by taking into account individual spatial cognitive abilities.},

abstract = {Working with three domain specialists we investigate human-centered approaches to geovisualization following an ISO13407 taxonomy covering context of use, requirements and early stages of design. Our case study, undertaken over three years, draws attention to repeating trends: that generic approaches fail to elicit adequate requirements for geovis application design; that the use of real data is key to understanding needs and possibilities; that trust and knowledge must be built and developed with collaborators. These processes take time but modified human-centred approaches can be effective. A scenario developed through contextual inquiry but supplemented with domain data and graphics is useful to geovis designers. Wireframe, paper and digital prototypes enable successful communication between specialist and geovis domains when incorporating real and interesting data, prompting exploratory behaviour and eliciting previously unconsidered requirements. Paper prototypes are particularly successful at eliciting suggestions, especially for novel visualization. Enabling specialists to explore their data freely with a digital prototype is as effective as using a structured task protocol and is easier to administer. Autoethnography has potential for framing the design process. We conclude that a common understanding of context of use, domain data and visualization possibilities are essential to successful geovis design and develop as this progresses. HC approaches can make a significant contribution here. However, modified approaches, applied with flexibility, are most promising. We advise early, collaborative engagement with data – through simple, transient visual artefacts supported by data sketches and existing designs – before moving to successively more sophisticated data wireframes and data prototypes.},

We review the work done on GIR and especially on ranking algorithms for GIR. We evaluate these algorithms using a test collection of 2500 metadata records from a geographic digital library. We present an algorithm for GIR ranking based on logistic regression from samples of the test collection. We also examine the effects of different representations of the geographic regions being searched, including minimum bounding rectangles, and convex hulls.},

Traditionally the spatial similarity score is determined with three methds: simple overlap, topological overlap and extent of overlap. The paper briefs the disadvantages of each method.
        
The paper also introduces a new factor to eliminate the effect of ocean: shorefactor to be used in coastal areas.
        
The evaluation data is metadata records from CEIC. Evaluation method is to compare the logistic regression model with three traditional methods. Also, another evaluation is held to compare the use of MBR and convex hull to see how different levels of approximations affect rankings},

abstract = {The GUIDE system has been developed to provide city visitors with a hand-held context-aware tourist guide. The system has been successfully deployed in a major tourist destination and is currently at the stage where it is publicly available to visitors who wish to explore the city. Reaching this stage has been the culmination of a number of distinct research efforts. In more detail, the development of GUIDE has involved: capturing a real set of application requirements, investigating the properties of a cell-based wireless communications technology in a built-up environment and deploying a network based on this technology around the city, designing and populating an information model to represent attractions and key buildings within the city, prototyping the development of a distributed application running across portable GUIDE units and stationary cell-servers and finally, evaluating the entire system during an extensive field-trial study. This paper reports on our results in each of these areas. We believe that through our work on the GUIDE project we have produced a blueprint for the development of interactive context-aware systems that should be of real value to those in the community who wish to develop such systems in a practical environment.},

abstract = {Spatial cognitive abilities play an important role in the use of GIS, although they have yet to be examined in a controlled experimental setting. This study aimed to develop an experimental design which measures spatial cognitive abilities in the use of GIS, specifically the map overlay operation. Subjects (n = 134) received three map overlay tests in which they were given two of the following: input map layers, logical operator(s), or output map layer(s). Subjects were required to select the correct logical operator for Test 1, to select the correct output map layer for Test 2, and to select the correct input map layers for Test 3. Each test contained a total of 16 questions, based on a 4 (‘and', ‘or', ‘xor', ‘not' operators) × 2 (one or two polygons per map layer) × 2 (three or five polygon edges) factorial design. Results indicated a significant main effect of logical operators and number of polygons on performance; however, there was no effect of the number of polygon edges on performance. Significant two-way interactions revealed an effect of the number of polygon edges and the number of polygons using various logical operators on performance. In addition, performance was not significantly different between males and females or between GIS users and non-users. Overall, results show that map overlays in which a visual correspondence can be made between the same polygons in the input and output map layers are cognitively less demanding than map overlays in which the shape of the polygons have been radically transformed between the input and output map layers. This study helps further develop our understanding of the spatial cognitive abilities which are required in the use of GIS, and whether certain sub-populations differ in these cognitive abilities. These results may contribute to more effective and efficient GIS teaching and interface design by taking into account individual spatial cognitive abilities.},

The GUIDE system has been built to overcome many of the limitations of the traditional information and navigation tools available to city visitors. For example, group-based tours are inherently inflexible with fixed starting times and fixed durations and (like most guidebooks) are constrained by the need to satisfy the interests of the majority rather than the specific interests of individuals. Following a period of requirements capture, involving experts in the field of tourism, we developed and installed a system for use by visitors to Lancaster. The system combines mobile computing technologies with a wireless infrastructure to present city visitors with information tailored to both their personal and environmental contexts. In this paper we present an evaluation of GUIDE, focusing on the quality of the visitor's experience when using the system.},

Current LBS support spatial and attribute queries, such as finding the nearest Italian restaurant from the current location of the user, but they are limited in their capacity to evaluate decision alternatives and to consider individual decision-makers' user preferences. We suggest that LBS should provide personalized spatial decision support to their users. In a prototype implementation, we demonstrate how user preferences can be translated into parameters of a multi-criteria evaluation method. In particular, the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator allows users to specify a personal decision strategy. A traveler scenario investigating the influence of different types of users and different decision strategies on the outcome of the analysis serves as a case study.},
