@article{Osborne2009,
annote = {The author proposed locality-sensitive hashing, based on the traditional approaches. At first when I saw the word "hashing", I thought it was the Twitter hashing feature. However, it turns out that it is not. There have been problems called "new event detection" or "first story detection (FSD)" long before Twitter. The authors of this paper proporsed improved FSD and applied it to detect new event on Twitter. The problem turns out to be how to find the nearest neighborhood for a new coming event in terms of topic similarity. },

@article{Sriram2010,
address = {New York, New York, USA},
annote = {This short paper talks about how to classify a new coming tweet into the existing categories: News, Events, Opinions, Deals, and Private Messages. My understanding of their approach is to first determine the features of a tweet that will be used. They select one nominal (author) and 7 binary features (1.presence of shortening of words; 2. emphasis on words; 3. currency and percentage signs; 4. @username at the begining of the tweet; 5. @username within the tweet). Then, they used a large amount (6747) of manually classfiied tweets to build the robust learning model, which they didn{\&}{\#}039;t specify the exact model they used. I guess what we can learn from this paper is the features that can be extracted from a tweet. I{\&}{\#}039;m not sure if our goal of identifying the meaning of unknown terms can be treated as a classification problem or not. },

abstract = {The paper examines the user intentions of twitter within a community. A simple topology of intentions is developed: daily chatting, conversations, sharing information and reporting news. Besides, people are found to play different roles of information source, friends or information seeker in different communities. Community in twitter is divided by algorithm 'CPC'. Results indicate users within a community share the same interest.},
annote = {log-likelihood ratio: determine terms that are of significant importance for a day. Note by Wanghuan: In Section 4 of this paper, the author mentioned the communities on Twitter network, which I think might be useful in guessing the meaning of unknown terms. Because if a community has a very clear common interest (new technology, health, public events, etc.), then there is a high probability that a newly emerged unknown term is related to the theme of this community. The method they used to find overlapping communities in networks is called Clique Percolation Method (CPM).},
