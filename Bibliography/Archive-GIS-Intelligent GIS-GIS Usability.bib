abstract = {The paper points out the issue with GIS that GIS has developed without a well-defined and established body of theory. The paper gives an example of the Toolbox in ArcMap 10.0. There are 615 operations in the Toolbox, organized confusingly into 18 top-level headings. The paper reviews some efforts to search for a conceptual framework for GIS functions, including map algebra by Tomlin [2], 6-category taxonomy on GIS database by Goodchild [10]. The paper describes three high-level strategies to simplify the organization of GIS functions: by implicit invocation, by removing the need to interact with low-level components of GIS representation, and by regarding analysis as a set of transformations of geodatabase. Finally, the paper suggests referring to some textbooks for the conceptualization of GIS functions.},
