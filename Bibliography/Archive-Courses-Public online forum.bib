@article{Williamson2004b,
abstract = {The essay address three questions. First, it reviews the goals of public deliberation: increase the quality of participation, increase quality of deliberation, educate participants, strengthen links between officials and citizens, make justice, sustain deliberation. Second, it discusses design choices, including who are invited to participate, and how deliberation is connected to decision making and action. It divides current public deliberation venues into five categories according to the way they invite the participant, and 6 categories with respect to the link between deliberation and authoritative decisions and actions in terms of Arnstein's ladder. Finally the paper reviews current deliberations, including town meeting, public hearings, citizen committees, collaborative forums, and civic innovations.},
