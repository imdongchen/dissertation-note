abstract = {This paper is very rich in describing what is deliberataion, what is the expected outcome and problem of deliberation, and addresses several problems of deliberation. The paper first summarizes 8 possible outcomes of ideal deliberation: 1. participant more active in civic affairs 2. tolerance for opposing opnions 3. participants improvement 4. understand fate linked 5. faith in democracy 6. decision quality 7. community's social capital 8. decision legitimacy. Then the author reviews work in social science in social delimmas, intergroup relations, group polarization, and minority influence, in an effort to find evidence for advocates and skeptics of deliberation.},

@article{Convertino2005g,
abstract = {The paper discusses the design of multiple view in the context of CSCW, especially how multiple view approach can support common ground as discussed in Clark, which means mutual knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions that conversational partners share. The problem domain is narrowed to task planning within a small team under critical condition within a dynamic environment. Three interactions between the fields of CSCW and multiple view system design is discussed: 1. role. Team members have different qualification and responsibility and how do multiple views and toolsets account for these role differentiation? 2. distinction between private and public spaces of work. 3. Cognitive resources. Finally the paper proposes that sharing strategic information is more critical than declarative and procedural information, and should be shared implicitly. However, these claims are from theoretical summary, rather than empirical evidence.},

abstract = {Although ths paper is composed for virtual organization, which has some special characteristics, most theories it mentions can be applied to general collaboration. The paper lists 24 facets of organizational effectiveness which are categorized into three high-level arenas of organizational function - awareness, problem solving, and sense of community. In detail, the paper talks about common ground and collective efficacy, inclusive problems solving, commitment and identification, and constructive dissent and conflict. The paper also addresses practice-based theory and patterns-based theory, which is unclear to me. Finally the paper reviews two projects in terms of patterns of effective VOs. To me, the greatest value of the paper is the description of some concepts, such as common ground, sense of community, and pattern.},

@article{Putnam1995c,
abstract = {The paper first discusses the significance of civic engagement, that it powerfully influences the quality of public life and performance of social institutions. Then it discusses the concept of "social capital", which refers to features of social organizations such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit, and how social capital could improve the performance of community. Then the paper lists some statistics showing the declining of civic engagement from 1970s to 1990s. However, as this paper was written in 1995, the evidence it refers is not so convincing any longer. The paper starts from research findings of decline of community and addresses the importance of community and explains why it's concerned with deliberation. The paper aims to address the question: how does deliberative civic engagement contribute to communty capacity building? First the author explains the concept of community and community capacity, and employs the community capacity-building framework by Robert Chaskin. The framework identifies four component characteristics of community capacity: 1) a sense of community, 2) commitment to community among its members, 3) the ability to solve problems, 4) access to resources, as well as four specific strategies for building community capacity: 1) leadership development, 2) organizational development, 3) community organizing, and 4) organizational collaboration. Then the paper argues how deliberation could contribute to these aspects of community capacity building by listing empirical evidence. In the end, the paper admits that although there is evidence that deliberation does have a positive effect on communities, what exactly makes these effects happen remains unclear.},

@article{Larson1996b,
abstract = {Several hypotheses derived from an information sampling model of group discussion were tested with 3-person teams of physicians given 2 hypothetical medical cases to diagnose. Some of the information about each case was given to all 3 team members before discussion (shared information), whereas the rest was divided among them (unshared information). As predicted, shared information was, overall, more likely to be discussed than unshared information, and it was brought into discussion earlier. In addition, it was found that team leaders repeated substantially more case information than did other members and that, over time, they repeated unshared information at a steadily increasing rate. The latter findings are interpreted as evidence of leaders' information management role in problem-solving discussions.},
