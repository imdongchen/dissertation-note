annote = {Purpose: 
1. coupling data verification, transformation, and visualization, using a visual interface.
2. How to handle increased data sizes (Aggregation)
3. Data transformations to be reused and refined. Both cleaned data and wrangling transformations are kept. 

1. Verification: diagnose data problems
1.1 Visualize raw data
1.1.1 Visualize missing data
1.1.2 Visualize uncertain data
1.1.3 Adaptively tolerate error
1.2 Scale to big data

2. Transform
2.1 Data formatting, extraction, conversion
2.2 Correct erroneous values
2.3 Integrate multiple data sets

3. Editing and auditing transformation
A way to describe data transformation: data transformation language

4. Share data transformations},

annote = {Exploratory visualization, to understand the space and time characteristics of human interaction in complex social networks

A system based on Improvise , free on line, controls multiple coordinated views of data (space, time, and abstract data atributes), in the form of maps, scatter plots, parallel coordinate plots, tables, spreadsheets, etc. 

a technique called rerun, allowing exploration of cyclic temporal patterns across multiple natural and artificial calendars.

Evaluation of the system: e-Delphi, a web-based toolkit.
Delphi mehod [4] is a way for "structuring group decisions in a manner that ensures personality conflicts and power relationships do not taint the presentation of ideas".},
