Disadvantages include blind authorship, lack of source citation, and presentation of opinion as fact. Dermatologists and other health care providers should recognize the importance of social media websites and their potential usefulness for disseminating health information.},

The paper includes a brief introduction to commonly used Social Web tools such as mashups and aggregators, and maps their exponential growth as an open architecture of participation for the masses and an emerging way to gain insight about people's collective health status of whole populations. Several health related tool examples are described and demonstrated as practical means through which health professionals might create clear location specific pictures of epidemiological data such as flu outbreaks.},

abstract = {Three experiments explored the effects of computer-mediated communication on communication efficiency, participation, interpersonal behavior, and group choice. Groups of three members were asked to reach consensus on career choice problems; they communicated face-to-face and in simultaneous computer-mediated discussions or through computer mail. When groups were linked by computer, group members made fewer remarks than they did face-to-face and took longer to make their group decisions. Social equalization was higher in computer-mediated groups in that group members participated more equally in discussions. Computer-mediated groups also exhibited more uninhibited behaviorâusing strong and inflammatory expressions in interpersonal interactions. Decisions of computer-mediated groups shifted further away from the members' initial individual choices than group decisions which followed face-to-face discussions. We discuss the implications of these findings for extension of theories about group interaction and for analyses of the effects of Computers in organizations.},

Our seven scenarios, evaluating visual data analysis and reasoning, evaluating user performance, evaluating user experience, evaluating environments and work practices, evaluating communication through visualization, evaluating visualization algorithms, and evaluating collaborative data analysis were derived through an extensive literature review of over 800 visualization publications. These scenarios distinguish different study goals and types of research questions and are illustrated through example studies. Through this broad survey and the distillation of these scenarios we make two contributions. One, we encapsulate the current practices in the information visualization research community and, two, we provide a different approach to reaching decisions about what might be the most effective evaluation of a given information visualization. Scenarios can be used to choose appropriate research questions and goals and the provided examples can be consulted for guidance on how to design one's own study.},

And Geodeliberation adds spatial emphasis to traditional deliberation. Geodeliberation and spatial analysis are two different aspects of GIS and require different functions and systems. 

A conceptual model of deliberative dialogue is proposed, consisting of five phases

Geospatial annotations are used to represent and structure the artifacts of geodeliberation. 

Annotations are linked with geometry on map and other referential annotations. The linking of annotations through their references from directional trees (SpaceTree), which can be used for visualization by threads of deliberative dialogues around an issue. 

GeoDeliberator is built following GeoDAT. It is C/S architectured, with Ext JS and Openlayers as client, and ASP.NET as server, and PostGIS as database.

Problem: are annotations linked automatically?

It seems the only support of GIS in the deliberative dialogue is display of location. More spatial analysis?},

abstract = {This study explores whether and how gratifications and psychological traits impact people's Facebook use. First, a factor analysis of an online survey (N= 437) outlined a unique set of gratifications obtained from the use of Facebook. Six aspects of gratifications (i.e., social surveillance, entertainment, recognition, emotional support, network extension, and maintenance) were identified. Results from regression analyses showed that psychological traits (i.e., collective self-esteem, online emotional openness, and traitlike communication apprehension) were strong predictors of most Facebook gratifications. Additionally, gratifications and, to a lesser extent, psychological traits significantly predicted Facebook usage, both in perceived importance and different indicators in the level of Facebook use.},

Intricate processes followed to develop anticipatory standards are not well-understood. Recently, the D-S-N model was developed to explain these processes, and suggested that these processes contain cycles of design (D), sense-making (S), and negotiation (N) activities. In this paper, we provide an initial report of a case study that empirically analyzes archival documents of SOAP standard development. Our findings reveal that the D-S-N model is applicable to the Web service standardization process followed at W3C but this model provides only partial explanation of the process, and that design and sense-making are the core activities of the process. Our findings also show that participants spent most of their time discussing technical issues and identifying action items to be performed, large organizations dominated the process, and negotiation is the least frequent activity.},

abstract = {We introduce the concept of a Visual Backchannel as a novel way of following and exploring online conversations about large-scale events. Microblogging communities, such as Twitter, are increasingly used as digital backchannels for timely exchange of brief comments and impressions during political speeches, sport competitions, natural disasters, and other large events. Currently, shared updates are typically displayed in the form of a simple list, making it difficult to get an overview of the fast-paced discussions as it happens in the moment and how it evolves over time. In contrast, our Visual Backchannel design provides an evolving, interactive, and multi-faceted visual overview of large-scale ongoing conversations on Twitter. To visualize a continuously updating information stream, we include visual saliency for what is happening now and what has just happened, set in the context of the evolving conversation. As part of a fully web-based coordinated-view system we introduce Topic Streams, a temporally adjustable stacked graph visualizing topics over time, a People Spiral representing participants and their activity, and an Image Cloud encoding the popularity of event photos by size. Together with a post listing, these mutually linked views support cross-filtering along topics, participants, and time ranges. We discuss our design considerations, in particular with respect to evolving visualizations of dynamically changing data. Initial feedback indicates significant interest and suggests several unanticipated uses.},

@article{Maciejewski2010c,
abstract = {As data sources become larger and more complex, the ability to effectively explore and analyze patterns among varying sources becomes a critical bottleneck in analytic reasoning. Incoming data contain multiple variables, high signal-to-noise ratio, and a degree of uncertainty, all of which hinder exploration, hypothesis generation/exploration, and decision making. To facilitate the exploration of such data, advanced tool sets are needed that allow the user to interact with their data in a visual environment that provides direct analytic capability for finding data aberrations or hotspots. In this paper, we present a suite of tools designed to facilitate the exploration of spatiotemporal data sets. Our system allows users to search for hotspots in both space and time, combining linked views and interactive filtering to provide users with contextual information about their data and allow the user to develop and explore their hypotheses. Statistical data models and alert detection algorithms are provided to help draw user attention to critical areas. Demographic filtering can then be further applied as hypotheses generated become fine tuned. This paper demonstrates the use of such tools on multiple geospatiotemporal data sets.},
annote = {There are two views in the system: geospatial view and time series, and the two views are linked. Early alert detection technique is used to find data aberration or hotspots.
        
Data aggregation and privacy preservation: On a base of actual location data overlays a layer represented as circles whose size stands for the size of a cluster and color stands for the percent of events.
        
Multivariate: as many as 3 variablees(3D mode)
        
Time: 
1. View historical data in "aggregate" and "increment" mode 
2. Temporal contours overlaid on spatial heatmap to explore trends.
        
Spae: To model the event distribution across the entire area, geospatial heatmap is produced using "kernel density estimation", rather than spatial histogram.
        
Attr: demographic and category filtering
        
        
        
This Visual Analytic system features:
1. Display georeferenced data events on a map and allow users to temporally scroll through data
2. Three graphs on the right show "a variety of data sources for a quick comparison of trends" (time series?)
3. Temporal control
4. Data aggregation and privacy preservation
5. Heatmap. Kernel density estimation
6. Context through color exploration
7. Time series analysis
8. Temporal contours},

@article{Fricke2008c,
annote = {Critics about DIKW hierarchy:
1. There is information in the unobservable world while data should be observable. This indicates information doesn't necessarily rest on data, which conflicts with DIKW.
Argue: only data that has an influence on individuals should be perceived as information. If it is unobservable, even with instruments, what sense does this kind of "data" make?
        
2. Universal statements or statistical generalizations are beyond the observable, thus can't constitute information, while some statements are obviously information.
Argue: Data, and inference from data, can both contribute to information
        
3. If inductive or inference is permitted, data and information may be not true.
Argue: Inductive is permitted, but DIKW doesn't say all inductives are permitted. We can confine that only true inductives are data. 
        
4. Information in DIKW seeks questions without "why", which should obviously be considered in information seeking. 
Argue: 'why' is answered in knowledge.
        
5. DIKW encourage uninspired methodology, mindless and  meaningless collection of data.
        
6. Knowledge should not be taken as "know-how", but rather as "know-that"
        
        
Suggestions by the author:
1. Data: data is fallible, but data needs to be true. Data can be more than 'observable', and it includes contexts, conventions and pragmatics.
        
2. Information. Information need not be data. information is more extensive than data and logically stronger than data.
        
3. Knowledge. Knowledge should be 'know-that', rather than 'know-how'. It can also be called 'weak knowledge', which is actually the same with information
        
4. Wisdom. In alignment with DIKW. Using practical know-how to achieve appropriate ends.},

abstract = {Territorial subdivisions and geographic borders are essential for understanding phenomena in sociology, political science, history, and economics. They influence the interregional flow of information and cross-border trade and affect the diffusion of innovation and technology. However, it is unclear if existing administrative subdivisions that typically evolved decades ago still reflect the most plausible organizational structure of today. The complexity of modern human communication, the ease of long-distance movement, and increased interaction across political borders complicate the operational definition and assessment of geographic borders that optimally reflect the multi-scale nature of today's human connectivity patterns. What border structures emerge directly from the interplay of scales in human interactions is an open question. Based on a massive proxy dataset, we analyze a multi-scale human mobility network and compute effective geographic borders inherent to human mobility patterns in the United States. We propose two computational techniques for extracting these borders and for quantifying their strength. We find that effective borders only partially overlap with existing administrative borders, and show that some of the strongest mobility borders exist in unexpected regions. We show that the observed structures cannot be generated by gravity models for human traffic. Finally, we introduce the concept of link significance that clarifies the observed structure of effective borders. Our approach represents a novel type of quantitative, comparative analysis framework for spatially embedded multi-scale interaction networks in general and may yield important insight into a multitude of spatiotemporal phenomena generated by human activity.},

annote = {The paper attempts to convey that visual analytics requires both human cognition and computational power, by analyzing three types of movement data: 1) single entity movements, 2) movements of multiple unrelated entities, and 3) movements of multiple related entities.

In single entity movement, "significant places" are decided by the amount of time spent at a place and clustering them. Then trips, described by sequences of recorded positions between the stops, are clustered. By examining the time spent on different trips, it is found that there're two shopping malls along the trip.

Problems:
1. How to define the significance of a place?
2. How to define a trip? Maybe one just starts off from home and doesn't go to work.

In multiple unrelated entities movement, two cartographic visualization techniques are introduced to present the aggregated data: mosaic diagrams for cyclical patterns and directional bar diagrams for movements in different directions. But details about them are not covered here.

Trajectories are 1)defined with starts and ends, and presented by a matrix; and 2) cluster points in divided "small areas"

Problem:
1. The matrix lacks geospatial context
2. How to define small areas?},

abstract = {This paper follows a progmatic approach (the other two approaches are operational and structural approaches as identified by Carroll etc[5]) to introduce metaphor in the design process, or metaphorical design. The author first reviews five examples of use of metaphors, which serve as the empirical basis. Then the author derives theoretical guidelines to using metaphors in design. Guidelines are categorized into three main activities in the design process: generating metaphors, evaluating metaphors, and developing metaphors. Finally, a set of conceptual characteristics of metaphors in design are provided. To conclude, the paper introuduces the use of metaphors in design, how to use them, and how they work.},

annote = {Accessibility of Information on the web:
1. Incomplete. Search engines cover only a small fraction (42{\%}, experiment conducted in 1999) of whole pages on the web.
        
2. Delayed. Indexing of new or modified pages can take several months or longer, which delays or even prevents the visibility of emerging technology or high-quality information
        
3. Inequal. Sites with more links have a higher chance of being indexed, and sites with greater "popularity" ranks higher.
        
Those drawbacks of search engines limit the accessiblity of information. In other words, users are "framed" by the information search engines provide. 
        
However, as the huge amount of information on the web, there is little possibility, if not any, to have equal access to all. But it is important that the biasment is made for you, not the search engines. Search engines should "learn" your preferences by recording your queries and selections. In addition, the preferences of your circles (friends, followings, etc.) can also be accounted. },

@article{Jacob2004c,
annote = {Objective:
        
To tell:
1. how different structures of an information system (categorization and classification) contribute to the establishment of semantic context
        
2. How different forms of organization support communication between the searcher and the system
        
3. How concrete organizational structures and specific types of relationships contribute to the production of meaningful information environments?
        
The strength of classification is its ability to establish relationships between classees that are stable and meaningful. Weakness is that the rigidity of structure limits the communication between the user and computer. Context, questions and answers are fixed. 
        
The strength of categorization is its flexibility in context and provides for effective communication between user and system. The weakness is disability to establish meaningful relationships across time and contexts because categories are built by the individual.
        
ï¼It reminds me of supervised classification and unsupervised classification in RS)
        
        
Categorization: Divide the world into groups in terms of similarities within a given context, which may vary. 
        
Classical theory of categories:
1. The internal structure is ungraded
2. Boundaries of categories are fixed and rigid.
3. Inheritance.
        
Objective views against classical theory of categories:
1. Inability to identify the defining characteristics of an entity
2. Evidence of graded structure. Observations exist that subjects do grade typicality of members and nonmenbers of a category.
3. Doubt on the existence of explicit inclusion / exclusion relationship between an entity and a category.
        
Classification:
Assign each entity to only one class orderly and systematcally based on a set of predetermined principles.
        
Taxonomic classification: stability criteria of each class facilitates transmission of knowledge across time and language.
        
Differences between classification and categorization:
Classification is exclusive and nonoverlapping based on a set of predetermined principles, the context and composition of which are stable. But categorization divides the world by experience according to similarities within a context which may vary across time.
        
Comparisons can be made in six aspects: process, boundaries, membership, criteria for assignment, typicality and structure
        
Ordering, grouping and organization
        
Classification is organization: there are meaningful relationships between constituent classes

The paper puts forward a CIB model, viewing the information environment from two axes:1)Behavior axis; 2) Context axis. Behavior includes information searching and seeking (I wonder the difference), and context ranges from individual to collaborative.Also, the paper identifies some "triggers" that cause the shift from IIB to CIB.  
        
The method adopted in this paper is to study two patient care teams and identifies how they communicate and collaborate.
        
To understand CIB, we have to develop both a better conceptual understanding and system.And a good CIB system should include the four features: 1)Awareness 2)Chat 3)Conferencing 4)Visualization.
        
The paper introduces a prototype "MUSE", that has the chat, search and share function. Though the system provides certain support to collaboration, the function is obviously limited. For instance, no conferencing is supported. That means only two people are allowed, thus no awareness is introduced. The information is shared "blindly", with no idea who is really interested in it. 
        
Besides, the CIB model is too simple. Can it truly reflect the collaboration in real life?},

abstract = {We investigate the extent to which social ties between people can be inferred from co-occurrence in time and space: Given that two people have been in approximately the same geographic locale at approximately the same time, on multiple occasions, how likely are they to know each other? Furthermore, how does this likelihood depend on the spatial and temporal proximity of the co-occurrences? Such issues arise in data originating in both online and offline domains as well as settings that capture interfaces between online and offline behavior. Here we develop a framework for quantifying the answers to such questions, and we apply this framework to publicly available data from a social media site, finding that even a very small number of co-occurrences can result in a high empirical likelihood of a social tie. We then present probabilistic models showing how such large probabilities can arise from a natural model of proximity and co-occurrence in the presence of social ties. In addition to providing a method for establishing some of the first quantifiable estimates of these measures, our findings have potential privacy implications, particularly for the ways in which social structures can be inferred from public online records that capture individuals' physical locations over time.},

A conceptual model of deliberative dialogue is proposed, consisting of five phases
        
Geospatial annotations are used to represent and structure the artifacts of geodeliberation. 
        
Annotations are linked with geometry on map and other referential annotations. The linking of annotations through their references from directional trees (SpaceTree), which can be used for visualization by threads of deliberative dialogues around an issue. 
        
GeoDeliberator is built following GeoDAT. It is C/S architectured, with Ext JS and Openlayers as client, and ASP.NET as server, and PostGIS as database.
        
Problem: are annotations linked automatically?
        
It seems the only support of GIS in the deliberative dialogue is display of location. More spatial analysis?

In 1945 VAnnevar Bush published an article dealing with massive information. After World War II followed the a scientific and technical revolution which produced "information explosion" around 1963.Support from the government developed information science.
        
nature of "information" 
Learn the nature of information from its manifestations, behaviors and effects.Information can be viewed in three senses, in broader sequence:
        
Narrow: the property of a message which can be estimated by probability. Like uncertainty in information theory by Shannon.Adopted by system-oriented information science.
        
Broader: cognitive processing and understanding.
        
Broadest: not only messages and that cognitively processed, but also context(situation, task, problem). This sense is considered in information science.
        
        
Structure in terms of problems addressed
        
Two clusters: basic and applied clusters are there. 
The key problem to address is the interface between people and literature.
        
        
Evolutionary trends in IR
First proposed in 1951 by Calvin Mooers.The research is divided into two lines: system oriented and human-centered.

First, it reviews the goals of public deliberation: increase the quality of participation, increase quality of deliberation, educate participants, strengthen links between officials and citizens, make justice, sustain deliberation. Second, it discusses design choices, including who are invited to participate, and how deliberation is connected to decision making and action. It divides current public deliberation venues into five categories according to the way they invite the participant, and 6 categories with respect to the link between deliberation and authoritative decisions and actions in terms of Arnstein's ladder. Finally the paper reviews current deliberations, including town meeting, public hearings, citizen committees, collaborative forums, and civic innovations.},

Judgements can be make wrong when 1)mental models are wrong; 2) mental models don't fit the current context.
        
Conscious thinking is based on several basic, subconscious levels of information management processing. Many errors originate from basic features of information processing: cognitive economy, protection of the feeling of competence; and the avoidance of ambiguity (giving structure and order to the world, to make the reality in consistent with mental models).
        
Information gathering problems: selective search for confirming information (confirmation bias), distortion of information, the suppression of unwanted information, and reduced acquisition of information},

The thesis of this paper is that the development of a universal and global measure of psychological empowerment may not be a feasible or appropriate goal. I begin by distinguishing between empowerment processes and outcomes. Underlying assumptions are discussed including the notion that empowerment differs across people, contexts, and times. A nomological network that includes intrapersonal, interactional, and behavioral components is also presented. Two examples of psychological empowerment for voluntary service organization members and members of a mutual help organization are described to help illustrate differences in the specific variables that may be used to measure psychological empowerment in different populations and settings.},
