abstract = {In a world of widespread information access, information can overwhelm collaborators, even with visualizations to help. We extend prior work to study the effect of shared information on collaboration. We analyzed the success and discussion process of remote pairs trying to identify a serial killer in multiple crime cases. Each partner had half of the evidence, or each partner had all the available evidence. Pairs also used one of three tools: spreadsheet only (control condition), unshared visualizations, or shared visualization. Visualizations improved analysis over the control condition but this improvement depended on how much evidence each partner had. When each partner possessed all the evidence with visualizations, discussion flagged and pairs showed evidence of more confirmation bias. They discussed fewer hypotheses and persisted on the wrong hypothesis. We discuss the possible reasons for this phenomenon and implications for design of remote collaboration systems to incorporate awareness of intermediate processes important to collaborative success.},

abstract = {Software tools that make it easier for analysts to collaborate as a natural part of their work will lead to better analysis that is informed by more perspectives. We are interested to know if software tools can be designed that support collaboration even as they allow analysts to find documents and organize information (including evidence, schemas, and hypotheses). We have modified the Entity Workspace system, described previously, to test such designs. We have evaluated the resulting design in both a laboratory study and a study where it is situated with an analysis team. In both cases, effects on collaboration appear to be positive. Key aspects of the design include an evidence notebook optimized for organizing entities (rather than text characters), information structures that can be collapsed and expanded, visualization of evidence that emphasizes events and documents (rather than emphasizing the entity graph), and a notification system that finds entities of mutual interest to multiple analysts. Long-term tests suggest that this approach can support both top-down and bottom-up styles of analysis.},

@article{Salmon2006c,
abstract = {The construct of situation awareness (SA) has become a core theme within the human factors (HF) research community. Consequently, there have been numerous attempts to develop reliable and valid measures of SA but there is a lack of techniques developed specifically for the assessment of SA in command, control, communication, computers and intelligence (C4i) environments. During the design, development and evaluation of novel systems, technology and procedures, valid and reliable situation awareness measurement techniques are required for the assessment of individual and team SA, in order to determine the improvements (or in some cases decrements) resulting from proposed design and technological interventions. The paper presents a review of existing situation awareness measurement techniques for their suitability for use in the assessment of SA in C4i environments. Seventeen SA measures were evaluated against a set of HF methods criteria. It was concluded that current SA measurement techniques are inadequate by themselves for use in the assessment of SA in C4i environments, and a multiple-measure approach utilising different approaches is recommended.},

Then the paper discusses about information visualization, and specifically, geo-visualization with map as centric. Next the paper lists seven design rational based on previous field study. In part four, the paper briefly explains the structure of the system and human evaluation. The second piece of work is a modification based on previous work and change to java-based prototype to web-based, and the paper discribes another set of evaluation. In the discussion part, the paper summarizes four design guidelines for geo-collaborative systems.},

abstract = {Decentralized command and control settings like those found in the military are rife with complexity and change. These settings typically involve dozens, if not hundreds to thousands, of heterogeneous players coordinating in a distributed fashion in a dynamically networked battlefield laden with sensor data, intelligence reports, communications, and plans emanating from many different perspectives. Consider the concept of team situation awareness in this setting. What does it mean for a team to be aware of a situation or, more importantly, of a critical change in a situation? Is it sufficient or necessary for all individuals on the team to be independently aware? Or is there some more holistic awareness that emerges as team members interact? We re-examine the concept of team situation awareness in decentralized systems beyond an individual-oriented knowledge-based construct by considering it as a team interaction-based phenomenon. A theoretical framework for a process-based measure called 'coordinated awareness of situations by teams' is outlined.},

@inproceedings{Schmidt2002,
abstract = {The paper discusses the definition of awaareness in CSCW. The term "awareness" is found ambiguous and has been used in various ways. For instance, awareness was initially adopted to denote practices through which cooperative activities are tacitly and unobtrusively aligned and integrated, but are now sometimes used to conceptualize the use of instant messaging system. The term is also often used with different adjectives, e.g. "general awareness", "collaborative awareness" "peripheral awareness" "background awareness" "passive awareness" "reciprocal awareness" "mutual awareness" "workspace awareness", etc. The first question to address with is of what cooperative actors are supposedly aware, or aware of what? The paper summarizes that it is aware of social context, and may lead to "informal interaction" and "a shared culture". Awareness is also used to denote those practices through which actors tacitly and seamlessly align and integrate their distributed and yet interdependent activities. The paper also distinguishes the difference between awareness and attention, or focus. Awareness is gathered "passively", while other workplace activities progress. Finally the paper talks about how awareness is gained so effortlessly without interrupting the current line of work. On the one hand, actors "monitor" the activities of their colleagues in the setting which doesn't require a response from them. On the other hand, actors display their activities that might be relevant to their colleagues. Besides, actors can gain awareness effortless because the world is "meaningful" to them.},
annote = {The term ‘awareness' here denotes taking heed of unfolding events and of possibly unfolding events; of things being done, of things done, and of things in need of being done; of developments within the joint effort that may be advantageous, detrimental, hazardous, etc. for one's own work; of occurrences that makes one's own work more urgent or less so, that require action or inaction, that necessitate changes to the intended course of action, etc. – all of it directly motivated by the actors' being interdependent in their work and hence by the unavoidable requirements of coordinating and integrating their various actions.},

@article{Stanton2007c,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to propose foundations for a theory of situation awareness based on the analysis of interactions between agents (i.e. both human and non-human) in subsystems. This approach may help to promote a better understanding of technology-mediated interaction in systems, as well as helping in the formulation of hypotheses and predictions concerning distributed situation awareness. It is proposed that agents within a system each hold their own situation awareness, which may be very different from (although compatible with) that of other agents. It is argued that we should not always hope for, or indeed want, sharing of this awareness, as different system agents have different purposes. This view marks situation awareness as a dynamic and collaborative process binding agents together on tasks on a moment-by-moment basis. Implications of this viewpoint for the development of a new theory of, and accompanying methodology for, distributed situation awareness are offered.},

@article{Carroll2006,
annote = {Critique the notion of knowledge in common in shared mental model. On one hand, the model dismisses the possibility of complementary knowledge--a participant does not need to know knowledge in other members, but knows what others know, the so-called ‘transactive memory'. On the other hand, shared mental model is static, while group mental model keeps evolving as communication and interaction proceed. It is more important to know how collaborators identify knowledge in common and use knowledge to coordinate their activities. 
In p. 25 the paper explains the notion of ‘activity awareness'. The goal is to shift the focus on static shared concepts (knowledge) to dynamic shared activity. The term ‘activity' takes from Activity Theory, which puts human behavior in an organized and contextualized framework.
The paper discusses four facets of activity awareness: common ground (Clark, 1996), community of practice (Wenger et al. 2002), social capital (Coleman, 1988), and human development (Vygotsky, 1978). It uses a hypothetical emergency management scenario (forest fire fighters).
Finally, the paper lists examples of design implications. One principle is that activity awareness should be supported with no extra attention and effort.},

The problem domain is narrowed to task planning within a small team under critical condition within a dynamic environment. Three interactions between the fields of CSCW and multiple view system design is discussed: 1. role. Team members have different qualification and responsibility and how do multiple views and toolsets account for these role differentiation? 2. distinction between private and public spaces of work. 3. Cognitive resources. Finally the paper proposes that sharing strategic information is more critical than declarative and procedural information, and should be shared implicitly. However, these claims are from theoretical summary, rather than empirical evidence.},

However, it is still difficult to build groupware that supports group awareness. To address this problem, we have developed the Multi-User Awareness UI toolkit (MAUI) toolkit, a Java toolkit with a broad suite of awareness-enhanced UI components. The toolkit contains both extensions of standard Swing widgets, and groupware-specific components such as telepointers. All components have added functionality for collecting, distributing, and visualizing group awareness information. The toolkit packages components as JavaBeans, allowing wide code reuse, easy integration with IDEs, and drag-and-drop creation of working group-aware interfaces. The toolkit provides the first ever set of UI widgets that are truly collaboration-aware, and provides them in a way that greatly simplifies the construction and testing of rich groupware interfaces.},
