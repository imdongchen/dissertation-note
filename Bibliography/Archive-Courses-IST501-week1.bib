nature of "information" 
Learn the nature of information from its manifestations, behaviors and effects.Information can be viewed in three senses, in broader sequence:
        
Narrow: the property of a message which can be estimated by probability. Like uncertainty in information theory by Shannon.Adopted by system-oriented information science.
        
Broader: cognitive processing and understanding.
        
Broadest: not only messages and that cognitively processed, but also context(situation, task, problem). This sense is considered in information science.
