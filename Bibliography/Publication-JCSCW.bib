@article{Cornejo2013b,
abstract = {Social networking sites ({\{}SNSs){\}} provide ambient awareness of the interests and activities of friends and relatives helping them sustain and strengthen their social ties. Older adults who are not adopting {\{}SNSs{\}} might however feel like outsiders within their own families who increasingly rely on these services to socialize. Previous research has shown that situated displays can provide appropriate interfaces for older adults to use digital services. In this paper we explore how situated displays can intuitively provide ambient awareness to strengthen the family social network of older adults. We designed and developed Tlatoque, a situated display, to seamlessly integrate older adults into the {\{}SNS{\}} used by their relatives. The results of a 21-week deployment study of an initial version of Tlatoque in one extended family showed that the older adult became more conscious of relatives' activities, which also enriched in-person encounters. However, relatives expected the older adult to reply to their posts in the {\{}SNS{\}} and Tlatoque lacked mechanisms for the older adult to provide feedback. We re-designed Tlatoque to incorporate means for enabling the older adult to share information back to the {\{}SNS.{\}} We conducted a second 21-week deployment study with another extended family to evaluate the use of this new version of the system. Our results indicate that the second design was successful in providing ambient awareness to the older adult as well as to her relatives. We conclude that situated displays that provide {\{}SNS{\}} services can assist the integration of older adults to their social network and contribute to enhance asymmetric relations between the older adult and younger relatives.},

@article{Schumann2013a,
abstract = {Workspace awareness support is mandatory for group support systems. It allows users not only to follow actions of others, but to understand and respond to any changes others make to the workspace. In this paper, we present a novel approach for asynchronous awareness support by offering different filters to retrieve relevant awareness information and visualizing the evolution of the shared artifact. We illustrate our approach with a tool for collaborative non-linear storytelling in which users can jointly create a story graph of interconnected audio files. Such a story graph is an example for a non- linear story. We describe the development of a prototype that visualizes how the collaborative story has evolved over time. We evaluate our approach for asynchronous awareness support in an experiment with 40 participants exploring story graphs of different complexity. The evaluation results show that our visualization approach helps group members to assess who has modified the shared story, how it was modified, what exactly has been modified, and when it has been modified.},

@article{Herrmann2013a,
abstract = {The collaborative design of complex systems is a challenging task. It requires phases of linear as well as creativity oriented work.Also phases of collaborative work have to alternatewithwork in solitude, requiring a smooth transition between them. This in turn results in awareness becoming a crucial factor. Within the context of designing socio-technical processes through modeling we have developed tools and methods to integrate individual and collaborative creativity into modeling with special respect to awareness thus allowing for a smooth transition between phases of working in solitude and phases of collaboration.We have conductedmultiple experiments on the subject following an action research approach which allowed for reflecting on the influence of awareness on collaborative process design in co-located meetings while also improving the socio-technical setting they were applied in. Derived fromour findings we show requirements for further development of the socio-technical setting and show future directions such as the integration of the described setting into other areas of design.},

@article{Wieland2013a,
abstract = {In model-driven software development, software models are the main artifacts used not only for supporting brainstorming, analysis, and design purposes, but also for generating executable code. Such software models are usually not created by one single developer, but within a team. To coordinate team work, versioning systems have proven to be indispensable for managing modifications performed by different modelers at the same time. When concurrently performed modifications are contradicting each other, the standard versioning paradigm requires the person who detected the conflict to resolve it immediately in order to keep the evolved artifacts in a consistent state. Whereas this approach works well in later phases of the software development process, in early phases, when the development team had not established a consolidated view on the system under development yet, the conflicts might provide valuable information on the various intentions of the modelers. This information might be lost if removed in an undocumented manner by a single modeler.We propose an alternative versioning paradigm for models, where conflicts are temporarily tolerated and discuss its technical realization for current modeling languages such as the UML. The resolution of conflicts is then not performed by one single modeler but within a team so that a consolidated version of the model is obtained.},
