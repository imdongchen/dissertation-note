annote = {This paper reviews nine web-based mobile tourism guides that are adaptive to context (context-awareness)

Comparison is made along two dimensions: context and adaption.

Context
1. scope. what contextual factors are considered?
2. representation. a) mechanisms for enhancing context reusability. b) level of abstraction at which context is represented.
3. acquisition. degree of automation: manual, automatic, or semi-automatic
4. mechanism. pull based or push-based

Adaptation
1. kind. what operations are done for adaption? e.g. filter content, change image resolution, interface change
2. subject. Level of the application to be adapted: content level, hyperbase level (navigation structure), presentation level (the layout of each page with user interaction facilities)
3. process},

abstract = {In user interface design a common pitfall is to use the technical properties of the device as basis for the design, which easily causes a user interface to become too complicated and hard to use. Also, the great development in the area of different hand-held terminal devices has set new requirements for user interfaces: screen sizes of devices are very small, advanced I/O devices are used instead of ordinary mouse and keyboard and the operating environment of the devices differs significantly from familiar PCs and laptops. However, governmental and in particular military communications systems often trail behind this development. To be able to overcome the aforementioned challenges and take usability of governmental communication systems to a new level, a new approach is needed. This paper covers user-centered design of graphical user interfaces to advanced communication devices designed to be used in challenging environment, e.g., in moving vehicles and outdoors in any season, and to support devices with limited screen size and touch screen technology. We also introduce a proof-of-concept implementation and show through a user test that general principles introduced in the paper can easily be applied to a specialized communication device.},

Intelligent map service takes adaptive geo-database as its data engine, provides effective, integrated and flexible data organization modes, automatically adjusts map content, map symbols, representation and data transfer mode, etc. Through multi-level storage and thematic data organizing, and analyzing user tasks and constantly changing scenarios, thus the system can serve the individualization and intellectualization of maps. Based on relative researches and the theory of adaptive system, intelligent map service and adaptive geo-database are introduced to form an intelligent map service platform which is self-adaptive, self-adjustive and self-organizational. It can automatically organize data, recommend information and provide intelligent map services, according to different users' requirements, map generation and application environment.},

annote = {Deliberation refers to a form of public discourse where interested community and stakeholders communite to identify goals and explore solutions. And Geodeliberation adds spatial emphasis to traditional deliberation. Geodeliberation and spatial analysis are two different aspects of GIS and require different functions and systems. 

A conceptual model of deliberative dialogue is proposed, consisting of five phases

Geospatial annotations are used to represent and structure the artifacts of geodeliberation. 

Annotations are linked with geometry on map and other referential annotations. The linking of annotations through their references from directional trees (SpaceTree), which can be used for visualization by threads of deliberative dialogues around an issue. 

GeoDeliberator is built following GeoDAT. It is C/S architectured, with Ext JS and Openlayers as client, and ASP.NET as server, and PostGIS as database.

Problem: are annotations linked automatically?

It seems the only support of GIS in the deliberative dialogue is display of location. More spatial analysis?},

abstract = {The most distinguished characteristics of deliberation the paper addresses is coherence. A common definition of "coherence" is that everyone receives every message, or full reception as the author named. However, this definition limits the scale of deliberation. Therefore, the author redefines coherence, by complete reach and complete consideration. The former means that anyone can send a message that is received by everyone, and the latter means that arguments are made after having heard everyone's considerations. The authors also discusses the benefits of both criteria from the perspectives of decision legitimacy and decision quality. By proposing the decision-structured deliberation model, the author augues that coherence could be achieved bseparately within each subdecision without participants receiving messages unrelated to it, thus reducing the negative effects of limits of memory and group processes.********** ********* The paper argues for large-scale deliberation and proposes a decision structure model to solve the problem in large-scale model. The paper starts with the characteristics of coherence of deliberation. A common definition of coherence is full reception, meaning that everyone is supposed to receive every message. However, in practice, deliberation often can't meet the requirement of full reception in terms of complete reach and complete consideration for several reasons.

abstract = {We introduce the concept of a Visual Backchannel as a novel way of following and exploring online conversations about large-scale events. Microblogging communities, such as Twitter, are increasingly used as digital backchannels for timely exchange of brief comments and impressions during political speeches, sport competitions, natural disasters, and other large events. Currently, shared updates are typically displayed in the form of a simple list, making it difficult to get an overview of the fast-paced discussions as it happens in the moment and how it evolves over time. In contrast, our Visual Backchannel design provides an evolving, interactive, and multi-faceted visual overview of large-scale ongoing conversations on Twitter. To visualize a continuously updating information stream, we include visual saliency for what is happening now and what has just happened, set in the context of the evolving conversation. As part of a fully web-based coordinated-view system we introduce Topic Streams, a temporally adjustable stacked graph visualizing topics over time, a People Spiral representing participants and their activity, and an Image Cloud encoding the popularity of event photos by size. Together with a post listing, these mutually linked views support cross-filtering along topics, participants, and time ranges. We discuss our design considerations, in particular with respect to evolving visualizations of dynamically changing data. Initial feedback indicates significant interest and suggests several unanticipated uses.},

abstract = {Significant interaction challenges arise in both developing and using interactive map applications. Users encounter problems of information overload in using interactive maps to complete tasks. This is further exacerbated by device limitations and interaction constraints in increasingly popular mobile platforms. Application developers must then address restrictions related to screen size and limited bandwidth in order to effectively display maps on mobile devices. In order to address issues of user information overload and application efficiency in interactive map applications, we have developed a novel approach for delivering personalized vector maps. Ongoing task interactions between users and maps are monitored and captured implicitly in order to infer individual and group preferences related to specific map feature content. Personalized interactive maps that contain spatial feature content tailored specifically to users' individual preferences are then generated. Our approach addresses spatial information overload by providing only the map information necessary and sufficient to suit user interaction preferences, thus simplifying the completion of tasks performed with interactive maps. In turn, tailoring map content to specific user preferences considerably reduces the size of vector data sets necessary to transmit and render maps on mobile devices. We have developed a geographic information system prototype, MAPPER (MAP PERsonalization), that implements our approach. Experimental evaluations show that the use of personalized maps helps users complete their tasks more efficiently and can reduce information overload.},

@article{Fricke2008c,
annote = {Critics about DIKW hierarchy:
1. There is information in the unobservable world while data should be observable. This indicates information doesn't necessarily rest on data, which conflicts with DIKW.
Argue: only data that has an influence on individuals should be perceived as information. If it is unobservable, even with instruments, what sense does this kind of "data" make?
        
2. Universal statements or statistical generalizations are beyond the observable, thus can't constitute information, while some statements are obviously information.
Argue: Data, and inference from data, can both contribute to information
        
3. If inductive or inference is permitted, data and information may be not true.
Argue: Inductive is permitted, but DIKW doesn't say all inductives are permitted. We can confine that only true inductives are data. 
        
4. Information in DIKW seeks questions without "why", which should obviously be considered in information seeking. 
Argue: 'why' is answered in knowledge.
        
5. DIKW encourage uninspired methodology, mindless and  meaningless collection of data.
        
6. Knowledge should not be taken as "know-how", but rather as "know-that"
        
        
Suggestions by the author:
1. Data: data is fallible, but data needs to be true. Data can be more than 'observable', and it includes contexts, conventions and pragmatics.
        
2. Information. Information need not be data. information is more extensive than data and logically stronger than data.
        
3. Knowledge. Knowledge should be 'know-that', rather than 'know-how'. It can also be called 'weak knowledge', which is actually the same with information
        
4. Wisdom. In alignment with DIKW. Using practical know-how to achieve appropriate ends.},

There are 615 operations in the Toolbox, organized confusingly into 18 top-level headings. The paper reviews some efforts to search for a conceptual framework for GIS functions, including map algebra by Tomlin [2], 6-category taxonomy on GIS database by Goodchild [10]. The paper describes three high-level strategies to simplify the organization of GIS functions: by implicit invocation, by removing the need to interact with low-level components of GIS representation, and by regarding analysis as a set of transformations of geodatabase. Finally, the paper suggests referring to some textbooks for the conceptualization of GIS functions.},

Next, it sketches a couple of hypothetical pervasive computing scenarios, and uses them to identify key capabilities missing from today's systems.

abstract = {The paper discusses the design of multiple view in the context of CSCW, especially how multiple view approach can support common ground as discussed in Clark, which means mutual knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions that conversational partners share. The problem domain is narrowed to task planning within a small team under critical condition within a dynamic environment. Three interactions between the fields of CSCW and multiple view system design is discussed: 1. role. Team members have different qualification and responsibility and how do multiple views and toolsets account for these role differentiation? 2. distinction between private and public spaces of work. 3. Cognitive resources. Finally the paper proposes that sharing strategic information is more critical than declarative and procedural information, and should be shared implicitly. However, these claims are from theoretical summary, rather than empirical evidence.},

annote = {The paper attempts to convey that visual analytics requires both human cognition and computational power, by analyzing three types of movement data: 1) single entity movements, 2) movements of multiple unrelated entities, and 3) movements of multiple related entities.

In single entity movement, "significant places" are decided by the amount of time spent at a place and clustering them. Then trips, described by sequences of recorded positions between the stops, are clustered. By examining the time spent on different trips, it is found that there're two shopping malls along the trip.

Problems:
1. How to define the significance of a place?
2. How to define a trip? Maybe one just starts off from home and doesn't go to work.

In multiple unrelated entities movement, two cartographic visualization techniques are introduced to present the aggregated data: mosaic diagrams for cyclical patterns and directional bar diagrams for movements in different directions. But details about them are not covered here.

Trajectories are 1)defined with starts and ends, and presented by a matrix; and 2) cluster points in divided "small areas"

Problem:
1. The matrix lacks geospatial context
2. How to define small areas?},

Our seven scenarios, evaluating visual data analysis and reasoning, evaluating user performance, evaluating user experience, evaluating environments and work practices, evaluating communication through visualization, evaluating visualization algorithms, and evaluating collaborative data analysis were derived through an extensive literature review of over 800 visualization publications. These scenarios distinguish different study goals and types of research questions and are illustrated through example studies. Through this broad survey and the distillation of these scenarios we make two contributions. One, we encapsulate the current practices in the information visualization research community and, two, we provide a different approach to reaching decisions about what might be the most effective evaluation of a given information visualization. Scenarios can be used to choose appropriate research questions and goals and the provided examples can be consulted for guidance on how to design one's own study.},

Similar to situations of face-to-face social interaction which often follows an implicit script , people need a script online as well, and information technology may make the script explicity. While some argue that computer-mediated groups are less likely to reach consensus because they share less information and are put in the impersonal context, another possiblity is the lack of structure in online discusssion. The authors developed a prototype Lead Line which enables users to create a pre-author script and requires users to strictly follow the script in online text chatting. The result indicates more consensus and better decision making.},

In 1945 VAnnevar Bush published an article dealing with massive information. After World War II followed the a scientific and technical revolution which produced "information explosion" around 1963.Support from the government developed information science.
        
nature of "information" 
Learn the nature of information from its manifestations, behaviors and effects.Information can be viewed in three senses, in broader sequence:
        
Narrow: the property of a message which can be estimated by probability. Like uncertainty in information theory by Shannon.Adopted by system-oriented information science.
        
Broader: cognitive processing and understanding.
        
Broadest: not only messages and that cognitively processed, but also context(situation, task, problem). This sense is considered in information science.
        
        
Structure in terms of problems addressed
        
Two clusters: basic and applied clusters are there. 
The key problem to address is the interface between people and literature.
        
        
Evolutionary trends in IR
First proposed in 1951 by Calvin Mooers.The research is divided into two lines: system oriented and human-centered.

@article{Jacob2004c,
annote = {Objective:
        
To tell:
1. how different structures of an information system (categorization and classification) contribute to the establishment of semantic context
        
2. How different forms of organization support communication between the searcher and the system
        
3. How concrete organizational structures and specific types of relationships contribute to the production of meaningful information environments?
        
The strength of classification is its ability to establish relationships between classees that are stable and meaningful. Weakness is that the rigidity of structure limits the communication between the user and computer. Context, questions and answers are fixed. 
        
The strength of categorization is its flexibility in context and provides for effective communication between user and system. The weakness is disability to establish meaningful relationships across time and contexts because categories are built by the individual.
        
（It reminds me of supervised classification and unsupervised classification in RS)
        
        
Categorization: Divide the world into groups in terms of similarities within a given context, which may vary. 
        
Classical theory of categories:
1. The internal structure is ungraded
2. Boundaries of categories are fixed and rigid.
3. Inheritance.
        
Objective views against classical theory of categories:
1. Inability to identify the defining characteristics of an entity
2. Evidence of graded structure. Observations exist that subjects do grade typicality of members and nonmenbers of a category.
3. Doubt on the existence of explicit inclusion / exclusion relationship between an entity and a category.
        
Classification:
Assign each entity to only one class orderly and systematcally based on a set of predetermined principles.
        
Taxonomic classification: stability criteria of each class facilitates transmission of knowledge across time and language.
        
Differences between classification and categorization:
Classification is exclusive and nonoverlapping based on a set of predetermined principles, the context and composition of which are stable. But categorization divides the world by experience according to similarities within a context which may vary across time.
        
Comparisons can be made in six aspects: process, boundaries, membership, criteria for assignment, typicality and structure
        
Ordering, grouping and organization
        
Classification is organization: there are meaningful relationships between constituent classes

It divides current public deliberation venues into five categories according to the way they invite the participant, and 6 categories with respect to the link between deliberation and authoritative decisions and actions in terms of Arnstein's ladder.

Specifically, criteria are divided into three domains: structure, process, and outcome. For structure, participants should be diverse enough in terms of demography and other characteristics. Also, information about the policy issue should be credible, sufficient, accurate, and accessible to participants, and allows for enough time for them to absorb and discuss. For process, deliberation should be transparent and sincere. Participants have equal right to make voice and equal access to all voices. Reasoning should be based on relevant factual information. For outcome, there should be change in participants' opinion towards the policy issue, as well as opinions of other participants. They are more informed with the issue, and become more politically active. Also, they develop greater respect, tolence, and trust for other participants. Finally the deliberation fullfils its ultimate goal if tangible impact on policy decision is observed.},

abstract = {Mass customization requires acquisition of customer preferences, which can be modeled with multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). Unfortunately current methods of acquiring MAUT weights and utility functions require too many queries. In Iona, the user is first queried for absolute/preferred constraints and categorical preferences to cull the product pool. Next Iona selects queries to maximally reduce the utility uncertainty of the remaining product choices. Implemented queries include stereotype membership and contexts (the purchase situation), which give probabilistic MAUT data modeled as ranges of weights. The usefulness of a query is based on the reduction in uncertainty (smaller range) weighted by the likelihood that the user belongs to a stereotype/context based on similarity to the current user model. Querying proceeds until the usefulness of the best query is below the threshold of user impatience. Finally integer programming is used to select the best product for the user.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems have found their ways into many on-line web applications, e.g., product recommendation on Amazon and movie recommendation on Netflix. Particularly, collaborative filtering techniques have been widely used in these systems to personalize the recommendations according to the needs and tastes of users. In this paper, we apply collaborative filtering in spatial object recommendation which is essential in many location based services. Due to the large number of spatial objects and participating users, using collaborative filtering to obtain recommendations for a particular user can be very expensive. However, we observe that users tend to have affinity for some regions and argue that using users with similar regional bias in recommendation may help in reducing the search space of similar users. Thus, we propose two techniques, namely, Access Minimum Bounding Rectangle Overlapped Area (AMBROA) and Grid Division Cosine Similarity (GDCS), to form regions of interests that represent user location interests and activities and to find users with local access similarity to facilitate effective spatial object recommendation. We conduct an extensive performance evaluation to validate our ideas. Evaluation result demonstrates the superiority of our proposal over the conventional approach.},

abstract = {Three experiments explored the effects of computer-mediated communication on communication efficiency, participation, interpersonal behavior, and group choice. Groups of three members were asked to reach consensus on career choice problems; they communicated face-to-face and in simultaneous computer-mediated discussions or through computer mail. When groups were linked by computer, group members made fewer remarks than they did face-to-face and took longer to make their group decisions. Social equalization was higher in computer-mediated groups in that group members participated more equally in discussions. Computer-mediated groups also exhibited more uninhibited behavior—using strong and inflammatory expressions in interpersonal interactions. Decisions of computer-mediated groups shifted further away from the members' initial individual choices than group decisions which followed face-to-face discussions. We discuss the implications of these findings for extension of theories about group interaction and for analyses of the effects of Computers in organizations.},

1. There is too much GDSS, and not enough C, which means we used to overemphasized individual cognition and expert-group usability issues but less collaboration.
2. PPGIS emphasizes access to justice of disadvantaged populations and mostly on local scales
3. Distributional justice is unattainable. Systems with that goal fail. Instead, spatial justice can be maximized by procedural justice and access to justice.
4. A C-GDSS framework termed SPI is developed, which aims to {\&}{\#}039;use geovisual and geospatial methods to allow a more faithful inclusion of the cultural and social values of large numbers of public participants with diverse opinions into public good allocation{\&}{\#}039;.
5. Structured public involvement: speicified aim, form, method, content of public involvement.Experts{\&}{\#}039; input should be respected while only community know their cultural, spatial, and social preferences.Public input should be generated and documented prior to the initiation of the process of making plans.To increase spatial justice by integrating geovisual and geospatial tools into dialogic epistemology.
6.There exists a disparity between perceived and desired degree of participation in terms of Arnstein{\&}{\#}039;s ladder of citizen participation, which is termed {\&}{\#}039;Arnstein Gap{\&}{\#}039;. 
7. Geographic view of public involvement
7.1 develop an understanding of how people realize themselves in place. What values do citizens have and how are these values connected with the local landscape.
7.2 how geospatial and geovisual technologies function as dialogic elements in the communication between experts and public about visual and spatial preferences and cultural values that reflect citizen{\&}{\#}039;s relationship with landscape.

This paper looks at the concept of relevance and its potential for and application to mobile cartography. First, theoretical concepts of relevance from other disciplines are studied followed by an analysis of different approaches for the assessment of relevance. A basic model for the determination of geographic relevance is postulated and the application modes of relevance to mobile cartography are elaborated. Two applications of relevance to mobile cartography are discussed with an emphasis on visualisation techniques for the presentation of relevance in maps. Some final remarks conclude the comments on relevance in mobile maps.},

Increasingly complex decision making processes require a more informed citizenry that has weighed the evidence on the issue, discussed and debated potential decision options and arrived at a mutually agreed upon decision or at least one by which all parties can abide. We explore the recent fascination with deliberative methods for public involvement first by examining their origins within democratic theory, and then by focusing on the experiences with deliberative methods within the health sector. In doing so, we answer the following questions "What are deliberative methods and why have they become so popular? What are their potential contributions to the health sector?" We use this critical review of the literature as the basis for developing general principles that can be used to guide the design and evaluation of public involvement processes for the health-care sector in particular.},

abstract = {We investigate the extent to which social ties between people can be inferred from co-occurrence in time and space: Given that two people have been in approximately the same geographic locale at approximately the same time, on multiple occasions, how likely are they to know each other? Furthermore, how does this likelihood depend on the spatial and temporal proximity of the co-occurrences? Such issues arise in data originating in both online and offline domains as well as settings that capture interfaces between online and offline behavior. Here we develop a framework for quantifying the answers to such questions, and we apply this framework to publicly available data from a social media site, finding that even a very small number of co-occurrences can result in a high empirical likelihood of a social tie. We then present probabilistic models showing how such large probabilities can arise from a natural model of proximity and co-occurrence in the presence of social ties. In addition to providing a method for establishing some of the first quantifiable estimates of these measures, our findings have potential privacy implications, particularly for the ways in which social structures can be inferred from public online records that capture individuals' physical locations over time.},

abstract = {In applications for entertainment or training, behavior of characters often takes place in virtual environments with spatial dimensions that incorporate both agents and objects. Situated virtual characters can employ knowledge of their environment in reasoning about the goals or intentions of other characters, virtual or human, contributing to their believability. This paper presents lightweight techniques to that extent, utilizing object affordances and observed behavior of characters to define an observer reasoning about that behavior. In case an observer reasons about the behavior of virtual autonomous agents, knowledge of behavior-producing rules can also be employed. This is formalized by extending earlier work on mental state abduction of BDI-based agents with the techniques presented here. The presentation is technical, illustrated with practical examples.},

In this paper, we present Gulliver's Genie, an archetypical ubiquitous computing application. Gulliver's Genie embraces three central constructs; those of agency, mobility and adaptivity. The architecture adopts a Multi-Agent Systems metaphor whereby agents manage and maintain a context within which mobile users exist and, based upon this context, seeks to adapt and personalize content based upon perceived individual user needs. Agents are mobile and may migrate to or from environmental artifacts reflecting their computational constraints.},

abstract = {As data sources become larger and more complex, the ability to effectively explore and analyze patterns among varying sources becomes a critical bottleneck in analytic reasoning. Incoming data contain multiple variables, high signal-to-noise ratio, and a degree of uncertainty, all of which hinder exploration, hypothesis generation/exploration, and decision making. To facilitate the exploration of such data, advanced tool sets are needed that allow the user to interact with their data in a visual environment that provides direct analytic capability for finding data aberrations or hotspots. In this paper, we present a suite of tools designed to facilitate the exploration of spatiotemporal data sets. Our system allows users to search for hotspots in both space and time, combining linked views and interactive filtering to provide users with contextual information about their data and allow the user to develop and explore their hypotheses. Statistical data models and alert detection algorithms are provided to help draw user attention to critical areas. Demographic filtering can then be further applied as hypotheses generated become fine tuned. This paper demonstrates the use of such tools on multiple geospatiotemporal data sets.},

abstract = {The paper addresses a list of design choices for online deliberation, categorized into five highest-level questions: 1) Purpose. Should the purpose be to make final decisions or to generate innovative ideas (outcome)? Should the goal be an outcome of a group or individuals within the group (collectivity)? 2) Population. Should the recruitment of participants be random or selected (recuitment)? Should the whole process be public or private (audience)? 3) Spatiotemporal distance. Should deliberation occur in the same place (colocation)? Should deliberation allow asynchronous response (cotemporality)? 4) Communication medium. Should communication be speech, text, image or nultimodal (modality)? Should emotions be enabled or impeded (emotivity)? Should users' communication acts be transformed or left unaltered (fidelity)? 5) Deliberative process. Should deliberation be moderated or not, automatically or human-facilited (facilitation)? Should deliberation be structured to certain rules (structure)? should users be anonymous or identified (identifiability)? Should users be rewarded for contributing (incentivization)? Then the paper summarizes six metrics of good online deliberation: quantity (number of posts, participants, comments, etc.), quality (number of replies, length of replies, distribution of contributions from participants, interview user's feelings, grounding), inclusiveness (distribution of participants), preference (survey of deliberation rating), efficiency (time spent to accomplish a task), efficacy (whether or to which extent the deliberation accomplishes its purpose). Finally, the paper reviews literature and discusses what effects these design choices may lead to or are preferred based on temporary research achievements.},

The paper lists 24 facets of organizational effectiveness which are categorized into three high-level arenas of organizational function - awareness, problem solving, and sense of community. In detail, the paper talks about common ground and collective efficacy, inclusive problems solving, commitment and identification, and constructive dissent and conflict. The paper also addresses practice-based theory and patterns-based theory, which is unclear to me. Finally the paper reviews two projects in terms of patterns of effective VOs. To me, the greatest value of the paper is the description of some concepts, such as common ground, sense of community, and pattern.},

Six aspects of gratifications (i.e., social surveillance, entertainment, recognition, emotional support, network extension, and maintenance) were identified. Results from regression analyses showed that psychological traits (i.e., collective self-esteem, online emotional openness, and traitlike communication apprehension) were strong predictors of most Facebook gratifications. Additionally, gratifications and, to a lesser extent, psychological traits significantly predicted Facebook usage, both in perceived importance and different indicators in the level of Facebook use.},

Such realization can often come from seeing things from new perspectives. Appreciating the human-centered perspective may offer some hope for enriching design's scientific foundations and for crafting new and better approaches to it. Certainly this suggests a constraint on or a goal for design, but how do we go from such statements to actual designs that accomplish the stated goals? We approach this class of question by considering the origins of and historical influences on the notion of design, then by considering the assumptions underlying our modern conception of design in light of the principles of human-centered computing.},

abstract = {The paper first discusses the significance of civic engagement, that it powerfully influences the quality of public life and performance of social institutions. Then it discusses the concept of "social capital", which refers to features of social organizations such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit, and how social capital could improve the performance of community. Then the paper lists some statistics showing the declining of civic engagement from 1970s to 1990s. However, as this paper was written in 1995, the evidence it refers is not so convincing any longer. The paper starts from research findings of decline of community and addresses the importance of community and explains why it's concerned with deliberation. The paper aims to address the question: how does deliberative civic engagement contribute to communty capacity building? First the author explains the concept of community and community capacity, and employs the community capacity-building framework by Robert Chaskin. The framework identifies four component characteristics of community capacity: 1) a sense of community, 2) commitment to community among its members, 3) the ability to solve problems, 4) access to resources, as well as four specific strategies for building community capacity: 1) leadership development, 2) organizational development, 3) community organizing, and 4) organizational collaboration. Then the paper argues how deliberation could contribute to these aspects of community capacity building by listing empirical evidence. In the end, the paper admits that although there is evidence that deliberation does have a positive effect on communities, what exactly makes these effects happen remains unclear.},

A conceptual model of deliberative dialogue is proposed, consisting of five phases
        
Geospatial annotations are used to represent and structure the artifacts of geodeliberation. 
        
Annotations are linked with geometry on map and other referential annotations. The linking of annotations through their references from directional trees (SpaceTree), which can be used for visualization by threads of deliberative dialogues around an issue. 
        
GeoDeliberator is built following GeoDAT. It is C/S architectured, with Ext JS and Openlayers as client, and ASP.NET as server, and PostGIS as database.
        
Problem: are annotations linked automatically?
        
It seems the only support of GIS in the deliberative dialogue is display of location. More spatial analysis?

abstract = {Geospatial information is a fundamental component of many crisis management activities. However, current geospatial technologies do not support work by crisis management personnel, most of whom are not technology specialists—a key impediment is that the technologies require the user to learn the system's language . In addition, geospatial technologies are not ‘collaboration friendly'—they impede rather than facilitate group work. In this paper we address both issues by presenting (1) a theoretical framework for understanding the roles of visual mediation in map-supported human – human dialogues, and (2) a computational approach for enabling such roles in collaborative spatial decisionmaking contexts. Building upon our initial implementation of a map-mediated collaborative environment, the DAVE{\_}G system [a natural, multimodal, dialogue-enabled interface to geographical information systems (GIS)], we model human – GIS and human – GIS – human dialogues as complex visual-cognitive signification processes in which maps become dynamic facilitators. Using a scenario simulating two crisis managers dealing with a major nuclear release event, we demonstrate how visual display (in DAVE{\_}G) actively mediates human – human dialogue directed to situation assessment and action planning in real applications.},

abstract = {Territorial subdivisions and geographic borders are essential for understanding phenomena in sociology, political science, history, and economics. They influence the interregional flow of information and cross-border trade and affect the diffusion of innovation and technology. However, it is unclear if existing administrative subdivisions that typically evolved decades ago still reflect the most plausible organizational structure of today. The complexity of modern human communication, the ease of long-distance movement, and increased interaction across political borders complicate the operational definition and assessment of geographic borders that optimally reflect the multi-scale nature of today's human connectivity patterns. What border structures emerge directly from the interplay of scales in human interactions is an open question. Based on a massive proxy dataset, we analyze a multi-scale human mobility network and compute effective geographic borders inherent to human mobility patterns in the United States. We propose two computational techniques for extracting these borders and for quantifying their strength. We find that effective borders only partially overlap with existing administrative borders, and show that some of the strongest mobility borders exist in unexpected regions. We show that the observed structures cannot be generated by gravity models for human traffic. Finally, we introduce the concept of link significance that clarifies the observed structure of effective borders. Our approach represents a novel type of quantitative, comparative analysis framework for spatially embedded multi-scale interaction networks in general and may yield important insight into a multitude of spatiotemporal phenomena generated by human activity.},

abstract = {Spatial cognitive abilities play an important role in the use of GIS, although they have yet to be examined in a controlled experimental setting. This study aimed to develop an experimental design which measures spatial cognitive abilities in the use of GIS, specifically the map overlay operation. Subjects (n = 134) received three map overlay tests in which they were given two of the following: input map layers, logical operator(s), or output map layer(s). Subjects were required to select the correct logical operator for Test 1, to select the correct output map layer for Test 2, and to select the correct input map layers for Test 3. Each test contained a total of 16 questions, based on a 4 (‘and', ‘or', ‘xor', ‘not' operators) × 2 (one or two polygons per map layer) × 2 (three or five polygon edges) factorial design. Results indicated a significant main effect of logical operators and number of polygons on performance; however, there was no effect of the number of polygon edges on performance. Significant two-way interactions revealed an effect of the number of polygon edges and the number of polygons using various logical operators on performance. In addition, performance was not significantly different between males and females or between GIS users and non-users. Overall, results show that map overlays in which a visual correspondence can be made between the same polygons in the input and output map layers are cognitively less demanding than map overlays in which the shape of the polygons have been radically transformed between the input and output map layers. This study helps further develop our understanding of the spatial cognitive abilities which are required in the use of GIS, and whether certain sub-populations differ in these cognitive abilities. These results may contribute to more effective and efficient GIS teaching and interface design by taking into account individual spatial cognitive abilities.},

abstract = {Working with three domain specialists we investigate human-centered approaches to geovisualization following an ISO13407 taxonomy covering context of use, requirements and early stages of design. Our case study, undertaken over three years, draws attention to repeating trends: that generic approaches fail to elicit adequate requirements for geovis application design; that the use of real data is key to understanding needs and possibilities; that trust and knowledge must be built and developed with collaborators. These processes take time but modified human-centred approaches can be effective. A scenario developed through contextual inquiry but supplemented with domain data and graphics is useful to geovis designers. Wireframe, paper and digital prototypes enable successful communication between specialist and geovis domains when incorporating real and interesting data, prompting exploratory behaviour and eliciting previously unconsidered requirements. Paper prototypes are particularly successful at eliciting suggestions, especially for novel visualization. Enabling specialists to explore their data freely with a digital prototype is as effective as using a structured task protocol and is easier to administer. Autoethnography has potential for framing the design process. We conclude that a common understanding of context of use, domain data and visualization possibilities are essential to successful geovis design and develop as this progresses. HC approaches can make a significant contribution here. However, modified approaches, applied with flexibility, are most promising. We advise early, collaborative engagement with data – through simple, transient visual artefacts supported by data sketches and existing designs – before moving to successively more sophisticated data wireframes and data prototypes.},

abstract = {Through a videotape analysis of five National Issues Forums, the author investigated the nature and role of narrative in small group deliberation. The author finds narrative is most frequent in deliberation. The author conceptualizes narrative, or storytelling, as a sequence of events organized in a way that has a beginning, middle, and an end. Storytelling is found to play an important role in overcoming two barriers of deliberation. First is the motivation to engage in deliberation. Deliberation is a disconcerting experience as it is quite different from everyday reasoning which is largely unconscious, unreflective, and unintentional. Storytelling helps participants establish an identity that places themselves in a particular relationship with the issue at hand, and this relationship may let participants feel accountable, high stake, and diverse, which are considered to be three elements that tend to motivate people to adopt a deliberative frame of mind by literature of deliberative democracy. The other barrier is a lack of knowledge. Storytelling puts the complex issue into the particulars of experience and concrete contexts, and makes the issue amenable to human understanding. Moreover, storytelling makes participants appear more sincere, trustworthy, and friendly by disclosing personal information, and thus making their claims more valid. Meanwhile, stories instill civility and friendliness into conversation in the situation of disagreement and conflict. Finally storytelling allows to build a sense of moral community without much explicit conflict or argument. In the end, the author also talks about the implication of storytelling for the way of facilitation because facilitation has an obvious impact on the nature, extent, and consequence of narrative.},

abstract = {The paper summarizes the use of maps and geographic information in community groups by reviewing literature and interviewing community leaders. First the paper discusses the nature of community groups and their significance philosophically, practically, and politically. To describe the use of maps in community, the paper categorizes it into four types. The authors cite Zander in describing the basic steps a community usually takes to address a problem: describe a problem, identifiy possible actions, pick the best action, and take the chosen action. The authors name GIS used in the first two steps "strategic", and GIS in the last two steps "tactical". In addition, GIS is also used for administrative (display detailed local information to community staff) and organizing (involve and direct residents in participation). Finally the paper points out that GIS should also be used in different ways to different audiences.},

abstract = {This paper tries to answer two questions: 1. what types of stories do deliberative group members tell when they are engaged in disagreement? 2. How are individual and collective identities displayed in the stories and responses to them? The data used is an online deliberative forum where over 4000 New Yorkers engaged in 2 weeks of online discussion about what should be done with the site of the former World Trade Center. The analytic method used is "informed" by the tradition of narrative discourse analysis. The authors identified four types of stories told during the periods of difference: adversarial argument stories, which assume that individuals have conflicting interests in the issue; unitary argument stories, which assumes some level of commonality among group members; introduction stories, which occur during the earliest discussion thread and demonstrat the teller's connection to the issue; transformation stories, which include vivid emotional language and center on personal or social change. In a word, the study shows that storytelling can provide information, clarify values, encourage a sense of collective identity, and even provide group members with a vision of how the future could be.},

We review the work done on GIR and especially on ranking algorithms for GIR. We evaluate these algorithms using a test collection of 2500 metadata records from a geographic digital library. We present an algorithm for GIR ranking based on logistic regression from samples of the test collection. We also examine the effects of different representations of the geographic regions being searched, including minimum bounding rectangles, and convex hulls.},

Traditionally the spatial similarity score is determined with three methds: simple overlap, topological overlap and extent of overlap. The paper briefs the disadvantages of each method.
        
The paper also introduces a new factor to eliminate the effect of ocean: shorefactor to be used in coastal areas.
        
The evaluation data is metadata records from CEIC. Evaluation method is to compare the logistic regression model with three traditional methods. Also, another evaluation is held to compare the use of MBR and convex hull to see how different levels of approximations affect rankings},

@article{Elwyn2010b,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In this article, we examine definitions of suggested approaches to measure the concept of good decisions, highlight the ways in which they converge, and explain why we have concerns about their emphasis on post-hoc estimations and post-decisional outcomes, their prescriptive concept of knowledge, and their lack of distinction between the process of deliberation, and the act of decision determination. BACKGROUND: There has been a steady trend to involve patients in decision making tasks in clinical practice, part of a shift away from paternalism towards the concept of informed choice. An increased understanding of the uncertainties that exist in medicine, arising from a weak evidence base and, in addition, the stochastic nature of outcomes at the individual level, have contributed to shifting the responsibility for decision making from physicians to patients. This led to increasing use of decision support and communication methods, with the ultimate aim of improving decision making by patients. Interest has therefore developed in attempting to define good decision making and in the development of measurement approaches. METHOD: We pose and reflect whether decisions can be judged good or not, and, if so, how this goodness might be evaluated. RESULTS: We hypothesize that decisions cannot be measured by reference to their outcomes and offer an alternative means of assessment, which emphasizes the deliberation process rather than the decision's end results. We propose decision making comprises a pre-decisional process and an act of decision determination and consider how this model of decision making serves to develop a new approach to evaluating what constitutes a good decision making process. We proceed to offer an alternative, which parses decisions into the pre-decisional deliberation process, the act of determination and post-decisional outcomes. DISCUSSION: Evaluating the deliberation process, we propose, should comprise of a subjective sufficiency of knowledge, as well as emotional processing and affective forecasting of the alternatives. This should form the basis for a good act of determination.},

A nomological network that includes intrapersonal, interactional, and behavioral components is also presented. Two examples of psychological empowerment for voluntary service organization members and members of a mutual help organization are described to help illustrate differences in the specific variables that may be used to measure psychological empowerment in different populations and settings.},

Visualisation, whereby humans and computers cooperate through graphics, is the means through which this is achieved. Seamless and sophisticated synergies are required for analysing spatio-temporal data and solving spatio-temporal problems. In modern society, spatio-temporal analysis is not solely the business of professional analysts. Many citizens need or would be interested in undertaking analysis of information in time and space. Researchers should find approaches to deal with the complexities of the current data and problems and find ways to make analytical tools accessible and usable for the broad community of potential users to support spatio-temporal thinking and contribute to solving a large range of problems.},

annote = {This paper focuses on Collaborative Information Behavior (CIB) and discusses the differences from Individual Information Behavior (IIB).
        
The paper puts forward a CIB model, viewing the information environment from two axes:1)Behavior axis; 2) Context axis. Behavior includes information searching and seeking (I wonder the difference), and context ranges from individual to collaborative.Also, the paper identifies some "triggers" that cause the shift from IIB to CIB.  
        
The method adopted in this paper is to study two patient care teams and identifies how they communicate and collaborate.
        
To understand CIB, we have to develop both a better conceptual understanding and system.And a good CIB system should include the four features: 1)Awareness 2)Chat 3)Conferencing 4)Visualization.
        
The paper introduces a prototype "MUSE", that has the chat, search and share function. Though the system provides certain support to collaboration, the function is obviously limited. For instance, no conferencing is supported. That means only two people are allowed, thus no awareness is introduced. The information is shared "blindly", with no idea who is really interested in it. 
        
Besides, the CIB model is too simple. Can it truly reflect the collaboration in real life?},

The distinguished point of the paper is that it measures the quality of deliberation by "sophistication of reasoning." They believe that successful deliberation increases participants' factual knowledge as well as the organization of core concepts, leading to more sophisticated understanding of an issue. Thus the more sophisticated the text reveals, the higher quality the deliberation is. The hand-coded technique utilizes Stromer-Gallery's coding scheme and counts the number of verbal behaviors. The nlp technique measures the sophistication of reasoning based on co-occurrence of concepts. An interesting measure here is the reasoning sophistication, which is claimed to measure the quality of deliberation.},

The system has been successfully deployed in a major tourist destination and is currently at the stage where it is publicly available to visitors who wish to explore the city. Reaching this stage has been the culmination of a number of distinct research efforts. In more detail, the development of GUIDE has involved: capturing a real set of application requirements, investigating the properties of a cell-based wireless communications technology in a built-up environment and deploying a network based on this technology around the city, designing and populating an information model to represent attractions and key buildings within the city, prototyping the development of a distributed application running across portable GUIDE units and stationary cell-servers and finally, evaluating the entire system during an extensive field-trial study. This paper reports on our results in each of these areas. We believe that through our work on the GUIDE project we have produced a blueprint for the development of interactive context-aware systems that should be of real value to those in the community who wish to develop such systems in a practical environment.},

abstract = {Anticipatory standards such as Web service standards are artifacts ‘designed' by consortium-based standards development organizations. Intricate processes followed to develop anticipatory standards are not well-understood. Recently, the D-S-N model was developed to explain these processes, and suggested that these processes contain cycles of design (D), sense-making (S), and negotiation (N) activities. In this paper, we provide an initial report of a case study that empirically analyzes archival documents of SOAP standard development. Our findings reveal that the D-S-N model is applicable to the Web service standardization process followed at W3C but this model provides only partial explanation of the process, and that design and sense-making are the core activities of the process. Our findings also show that participants spent most of their time discussing technical issues and identifying action items to be performed, large organizations dominated the process, and negotiation is the least frequent activity.},

abstract = {Spatial cognitive abilities play an important role in the use of GIS, although they have yet to be examined in a controlled experimental setting. This study aimed to develop an experimental design which measures spatial cognitive abilities in the use of GIS, specifically the map overlay operation. Subjects (n = 134) received three map overlay tests in which they were given two of the following: input map layers, logical operator(s), or output map layer(s). Subjects were required to select the correct logical operator for Test 1, to select the correct output map layer for Test 2, and to select the correct input map layers for Test 3. Each test contained a total of 16 questions, based on a 4 (‘and', ‘or', ‘xor', ‘not' operators) × 2 (one or two polygons per map layer) × 2 (three or five polygon edges) factorial design. Results indicated a significant main effect of logical operators and number of polygons on performance; however, there was no effect of the number of polygon edges on performance. Significant two-way interactions revealed an effect of the number of polygon edges and the number of polygons using various logical operators on performance. In addition, performance was not significantly different between males and females or between GIS users and non-users. Overall, results show that map overlays in which a visual correspondence can be made between the same polygons in the input and output map layers are cognitively less demanding than map overlays in which the shape of the polygons have been radically transformed between the input and output map layers. This study helps further develop our understanding of the spatial cognitive abilities which are required in the use of GIS, and whether certain sub-populations differ in these cognitive abilities. These results may contribute to more effective and efficient GIS teaching and interface design by taking into account individual spatial cognitive abilities.},

The GUIDE system has been built to overcome many of the limitations of the traditional information and navigation tools available to city visitors. For example, group-based tours are inherently inflexible with fixed starting times and fixed durations and (like most guidebooks) are constrained by the need to satisfy the interests of the majority rather than the specific interests of individuals. Following a period of requirements capture, involving experts in the field of tourism, we developed and installed a system for use by visitors to Lancaster. The system combines mobile computing technologies with a wireless infrastructure to present city visitors with information tailored to both their personal and environmental contexts. In this paper we present an evaluation of GUIDE, focusing on the quality of the visitor's experience when using the system.},

However the paper doesn't dive deep enough about how to manage the relationship between geographic object and posts. The finding that posts in a university forum are very geographic in nature proves the value of this research. Table 2 in this paper is of great value as it summarizes the geographic references statistics from an online forum. In sum, both discussions investigated were very geographic in nature, with almost all of the contributions containing at least one geographic reference, averages around three geographic references per post, and between two and three unique references per person.},

People like deliberation when well organized 3. The products of deliberations are often excellent. Each point is supported by one or more empirical instances. Then the paper points out four limitation in current deliberative practice. 1. deliberation does not generate a full consensus (which is natural to me) 2. Good deliberation needs careful organization and facilitation 3. Deliberation must scale out to include many more participants to become politically and socially important, and scale up to address issues of state, national, and even international concern. 4.

However, as the huge amount of information on the web, there is little possibility, if not any, to have equal access to all.

@article{Larson1996b,
abstract = {Several hypotheses derived from an information sampling model of group discussion were tested with 3-person teams of physicians given 2 hypothetical medical cases to diagnose. Some of the information about each case was given to all 3 team members before discussion (shared information), whereas the rest was divided among them (unshared information). As predicted, shared information was, overall, more likely to be discussed than unshared information, and it was brought into discussion earlier. In addition, it was found that team leaders repeated substantially more case information than did other members and that, over time, they repeated unshared information at a steadily increasing rate. The latter findings are interpreted as evidence of leaders' information management role in problem-solving discussions.},

@article{McBurney2007a,
abstract = {The paper proposes a Deliberation Dialogue Framework to model the process of deliberation among computational entities (rather than among humans). The paper starts with clarification about the concept of 'deliberation' discussed in this context. The author distinguishes 'deliberation' from other forms of dialogue, such as information-seeking dialogue, inquiry dialogue, persuasion dialogue, and negotiation dialogue, in terms of the objective of the dialogue, the objective of participants, and the information the participants had available at commencement of the dialogue. Specifically the framework defines 8 processes in deliberation, 6 types of deliberative sentences, several activities (protocol) participants do in each process with various types of sentences.Finally the problem of commitment is emphasized, with the concept of commitment store to track the position and change of position upheld by participants. Assessment of the protocol is conducted in three ways: applied in human dialogue,measured agaist normative principles of deliberation, and outcome.},
annote = {Deliberation dialogues differ from other forms of dialogues in terms of the objectives of the dialogue, the objectives of participants, and the information participants had at hand at commencement of dialogues. Specifically,
1. Deliberation is different from information-seeking and inquiry dialogues because deliberation focuses on action. In constrast, the latter two aim to search for truth, in regardless of value assumptions (preference, interest, etc.)
2. Deliberation differ from negotiation in that the latter concerns the allocation of resources and avoids share of information.
3. Deliberation differ from persuasion because persuasion begins with at least one participant bearing an initially defined plan in mind and attempts to persuade other participants to agree to the plan. Instead, there is often no solution or plan at commencement of deliberation. Participants discuss, propose, reason and finally come up with a final decision.
        
        
The paper also adopts the concept of commitment store, which tracks the commitment of each participant. },

Current LBS support spatial and attribute queries, such as finding the nearest Italian restaurant from the current location of the user, but they are limited in their capacity to evaluate decision alternatives and to consider individual decision-makers' user preferences. We suggest that LBS should provide personalized spatial decision support to their users. In a prototype implementation, we demonstrate how user preferences can be translated into parameters of a multi-criteria evaluation method. In particular, the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator allows users to specify a personal decision strategy. A traveler scenario investigating the influence of different types of users and different decision strategies on the outcome of the analysis serves as a case study.},
