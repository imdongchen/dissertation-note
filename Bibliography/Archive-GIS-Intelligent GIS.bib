The paper presents a software GeoDialogue based on an agent-based computational model, PlanGraph. PlanGraph is based on SharedPlan and RecipeGraph models. The PlanGraph consists of root plan and sub-plans. Each plan is a complex data structure which records an action and a set of mental states.},

@article{Goodchild2011d,
abstract = {The paper points out the issue with GIS that GIS has developed without a well-defined and established body of theory. The paper gives an example of the Toolbox in ArcMap 10.0. There are 615 operations in the Toolbox, organized confusingly into 18 top-level headings. The paper reviews some efforts to search for a conceptual framework for GIS functions, including map algebra by Tomlin [2], 6-category taxonomy on GIS database by Goodchild [10]. The paper describes three high-level strategies to simplify the organization of GIS functions: by implicit invocation, by removing the need to interact with low-level components of GIS representation, and by regarding analysis as a set of transformations of geodatabase. Finally, the paper suggests referring to some textbooks for the conceptualization of GIS functions.},

abstract = {In applications for entertainment or training, behavior of characters often takes place in virtual environments with spatial dimensions that incorporate both agents and objects. Situated virtual characters can employ knowledge of their environment in reasoning about the goals or intentions of other characters, virtual or human, contributing to their believability. This paper presents lightweight techniques to that extent, utilizing object affordances and observed behavior of characters to define an observer reasoning about that behavior. In case an observer reasons about the behavior of virtual autonomous agents, knowledge of behavior-producing rules can also be employed. This is formalized by extending earlier work on mental state abduction of BDI-based agents with the techniques presented here. The presentation is technical, illustrated with practical examples.},
