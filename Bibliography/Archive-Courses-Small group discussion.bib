@article{Siegel1986b,
abstract = {Three experiments explored the effects of computer-mediated communication on communication efficiency, participation, interpersonal behavior, and group choice. Groups of three members were asked to reach consensus on career choice problems; they communicated face-to-face and in simultaneous computer-mediated discussions or through computer mail. When groups were linked by computer, group members made fewer remarks than they did face-to-face and took longer to make their group decisions. Social equalization was higher in computer-mediated groups in that group members participated more equally in discussions. Computer-mediated groups also exhibited more uninhibited behaviorâ€”using strong and inflammatory expressions in interpersonal interactions. Decisions of computer-mediated groups shifted further away from the members' initial individual choices than group decisions which followed face-to-face discussions. We discuss the implications of these findings for extension of theories about group interaction and for analyses of the effects of Computers in organizations.},

2. A shared purpose drives group members to function together
3. Interdepence: the actions and behaviors of individual members both affect and are affected by the actions and behaviors of others in the group.
4. Perceived boundary: Group members should have shared characteristics that distinguish themselves from outsiders.
5. Regular interaction and communication among group members, including sharing info, providing feekback, coordinating actions, persuading others, controlling group situations, establishing rules and procedures, and so on. },
