abstract = {We present a vision of next-generation visual analytics ser- vices. We argue that these services should have three related capabilities: support visual and interactive data exploration as they do today, but also suggest relevant data to enrich visualizations, and facilitate the integration and cleaning of that data. Most importantly, they should provide all these capabilities seamlessly in the context of an uninterrupted data analysis cycle. We present the challenges and opportu- nities in building next-generation visual analytics services},
