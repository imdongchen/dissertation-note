The existing GR approaches do not deal with the distribution of the objects in the user's surrounding environment.

Context is described as location and user activity. Activities are modeled as ontology (touring, shopping, etc.). Two relationships are modeled: a spatial relationship between location and object, described as the geometric distance, and a conceptual relationship, described as the path distance in a concept graph derived from ConceptNet. },

Spatial similarity is closed related to the representation of geographic data: Toponyms, geographic points, MBR, complex polygons.
        
GeoCLEF [9, 10] and NTCIR-GeoTime[4] and [12] [1] combine thematic or topical elements and spatial elements. The weight of the two elements depend on data and context (text-based data, or mobile context where coordinates are provided for query)},

This paper looks at the concept of relevance and its potential for and application to mobile cartography. First, theoretical concepts of relevance from other disciplines are studied followed by an analysis of different approaches for the assessment of relevance. A basic model for the determination of geographic relevance is postulated and the application modes of relevance to mobile cartography are elaborated. Two applications of relevance to mobile cartography are discussed with an emphasis on visualisation techniques for the presentation of relevance in maps. Some final remarks conclude the comments on relevance in mobile maps.},

We review the work done on GIR and especially on ranking algorithms for GIR. We evaluate these algorithms using a test collection of 2500 metadata records from a geographic digital library. We present an algorithm for GIR ranking based on logistic regression from samples of the test collection. We also examine the effects of different representations of the geographic regions being searched, including minimum bounding rectangles, and convex hulls.},
annote = {The paper introduces a probabilistic spatial ranking approach, using the Logistic Regression model. It is a supervised model and measures the relevance of polygons using the overlap area metric.
        
Traditionally the spatial similarity score is determined with three methds: simple overlap, topological overlap and extent of overlap. The paper briefs the disadvantages of each method.
        
The paper also introduces a new factor to eliminate the effect of ocean: shorefactor to be used in coastal areas.
        
The evaluation data is metadata records from CEIC. Evaluation method is to compare the logistic regression model with three traditional methods. Also, another evaluation is held to compare the use of MBR and convex hull to see how different levels of approximations affect rankings},
