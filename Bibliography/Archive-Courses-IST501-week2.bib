annote = {Objective:
        
To tell:
1. how different structures of an information system (categorization and classification) contribute to the establishment of semantic context
        
2. How different forms of organization support communication between the searcher and the system
        
3. How concrete organizational structures and specific types of relationships contribute to the production of meaningful information environments?
        
The strength of classification is its ability to establish relationships between classees that are stable and meaningful. Weakness is that the rigidity of structure limits the communication between the user and computer. Context, questions and answers are fixed. 
        
The strength of categorization is its flexibility in context and provides for effective communication between user and system. The weakness is disability to establish meaningful relationships across time and contexts because categories are built by the individual.
        
ï¼ˆIt reminds me of supervised classification and unsupervised classification in RS)
        
        
Categorization: Divide the world into groups in terms of similarities within a given context, which may vary. 
        
Classical theory of categories:
1. The internal structure is ungraded
2. Boundaries of categories are fixed and rigid.
3. Inheritance.
        
Objective views against classical theory of categories:
1. Inability to identify the defining characteristics of an entity
2. Evidence of graded structure. Observations exist that subjects do grade typicality of members and nonmenbers of a category.
3. Doubt on the existence of explicit inclusion / exclusion relationship between an entity and a category.
        
Classification:
Assign each entity to only one class orderly and systematcally based on a set of predetermined principles.
        
Taxonomic classification: stability criteria of each class facilitates transmission of knowledge across time and language.
        
Differences between classification and categorization:
Classification is exclusive and nonoverlapping based on a set of predetermined principles, the context and composition of which are stable. But categorization divides the world by experience according to similarities within a context which may vary across time.
        
Comparisons can be made in six aspects: process, boundaries, membership, criteria for assignment, typicality and structure
        
Ordering, grouping and organization
        
Classification is organization: there are meaningful relationships between constituent classes

annote = {Critics about DIKW hierarchy:
1. There is information in the unobservable world while data should be observable. This indicates information doesn't necessarily rest on data, which conflicts with DIKW.
Argue: only data that has an influence on individuals should be perceived as information. If it is unobservable, even with instruments, what sense does this kind of "data" make?
        
2. Universal statements or statistical generalizations are beyond the observable, thus can't constitute information, while some statements are obviously information.
Argue: Data, and inference from data, can both contribute to information
        
3. If inductive or inference is permitted, data and information may be not true.
Argue: Inductive is permitted, but DIKW doesn't say all inductives are permitted. We can confine that only true inductives are data. 
        
4. Information in DIKW seeks questions without "why", which should obviously be considered in information seeking. 
Argue: 'why' is answered in knowledge.
        
5. DIKW encourage uninspired methodology, mindless and  meaningless collection of data.
        
6. Knowledge should not be taken as "know-how", but rather as "know-that"
        
        
Suggestions by the author:
1. Data: data is fallible, but data needs to be true. Data can be more than 'observable', and it includes contexts, conventions and pragmatics.
        
2. Information. Information need not be data. information is more extensive than data and logically stronger than data.
        
3. Knowledge. Knowledge should be 'know-that', rather than 'know-how'. It can also be called 'weak knowledge', which is actually the same with information
        
4. Wisdom. In alignment with DIKW. Using practical know-how to achieve appropriate ends.},

annote = {Revisit Ackoff's (1989) wisdom hierarchy (data-information-knowledge-wisdom). It is said that the hierarchy is often quoted implicitly, but seldomly discussed directly. 
        
This paper reviews the definition of data, information, knowledge and wisdom, and gives his conclusion. The distinction between data and information, information and knowledge is analyzed. The transformation process from the low level in the hierarchy is said to be targeted, but little is touched. 
        
The paper also notices that limited discussion about wisdom is made in the reviewed texts.},
