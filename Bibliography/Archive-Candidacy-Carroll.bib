@article{Larson1996b,
abstract = {Several hypotheses derived from an information sampling model of group discussion were tested with 3-person teams of physicians given 2 hypothetical medical cases to diagnose. Some of the information about each case was given to all 3 team members before discussion (shared information), whereas the rest was divided among them (unshared information). As predicted, shared information was, overall, more likely to be discussed than unshared information, and it was brought into discussion earlier. In addition, it was found that team leaders repeated substantially more case information than did other members and that, over time, they repeated unshared information at a steadily increasing rate. The latter findings are interpreted as evidence of leaders' information management role in problem-solving discussions.},

abstract = {This paper is very rich in describing what is deliberataion, what is the expected outcome and problem of deliberation, and addresses several problems of deliberation. The paper first summarizes 8 possible outcomes of ideal deliberation: 1. participant more active in civic affairs 2. tolerance for opposing opnions 3. participants improvement 4. understand fate linked 5. faith in democracy 6. decision quality 7. community's social capital 8. decision legitimacy. Then the author reviews work in social science in social delimmas, intergroup relations, group polarization, and minority influence, in an effort to find evidence for advocates and skeptics of deliberation.},

@article{Convertino2005g,
abstract = {The paper discusses the design of multiple view in the context of CSCW, especially how multiple view approach can support common ground as discussed in Clark, which means mutual knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions that conversational partners share. The problem domain is narrowed to task planning within a small team under critical condition within a dynamic environment. Three interactions between the fields of CSCW and multiple view system design is discussed: 1. role. Team members have different qualification and responsibility and how do multiple views and toolsets account for these role differentiation? 2. distinction between private and public spaces of work. 3. Cognitive resources. Finally the paper proposes that sharing strategic information is more critical than declarative and procedural information, and should be shared implicitly. However, these claims are from theoretical summary, rather than empirical evidence.},
