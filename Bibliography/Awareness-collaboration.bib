Propose the discourse structure theory. The theory specifies three basic elements of a discourse structure: linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional structure.

Distinction among linguistic structure, intention structure, and attention state is essestial to an explanation of interruptions, referring expressions, and cue phrases. It also helps to understand the relevance of various segments of discourse and the purposes of discourse participants},

abstract = {The paper discusses the design of multiple view in the context of CSCW, especially how multiple view approach can support common ground as discussed in Clark, which means mutual knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions that conversational partners share. The problem domain is narrowed to task planning within a small team under critical condition within a dynamic environment. Three interactions between the fields of CSCW and multiple view system design is discussed: 1. role. Team members have different qualification and responsibility and how do multiple views and toolsets account for these role differentiation? 2. distinction between private and public spaces of work. 3. Cognitive resources. Finally the paper proposes that sharing strategic information is more critical than declarative and procedural information, and should be shared implicitly. However, these claims are from theoretical summary, rather than empirical evidence.},

@article{Grosz2006a,
abstract = {An adequate formulation of collective intentionality is crucial for understanding group activity and for modeling the mental state of participants in such activities. Although work on collective intentionality in philosophy, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science has many points of agreement, several key issues remain under debate. This paper argues that the dynamics of intention - in particular, the inter-related processes of plan-related group decision making and intention updating - play crucial roles in an explanation of collective intentionality. Furthermore, it is in these dynamic aspects that coordinated group activity differs most from individual activity. The paper specifies a model of the dynamics of agent intentions in the context of collaborative activity. Its integrated treatment of group decision making and coordinated updating of group-related intentions fills an important gap in prior accounts of collective intentionality, thus helping to resolve a long-standing debate about the nature of intentions in group activity. The paper also defines an architecture for collaboration-capable computer agents that satisfies the constraints of the model and is a natural extension of the standard architecture for resource-bounded agents operating as individuals. The new architecture is both more principled and more complete than prior architectures for collaborative multi-agent systems.},

ICT is interesting for a number of reasons, including its scale of use (thousands of users per day), its usage model of employing large scale broadcast to strangers to initiate small group interactions, and the fact that it is a synchronous system used across multiple time zones. In this paper we characterize the use of ICT in its context, examine the activities for which it is used, the motivations of its users, and the values they derive from it. We also explore problems with the system, and look at the social and technical ways in which users deal with them.},

abstract = {From an exploratory user study using a fictional textual intelligence analysis task on a large, high-resolution vertical display, we investigated how pairs of users interact with the display to construct spatial schemas and externalize information, as well as how they establish shared and private territories. We investigated users' space management strategies depending on the design philosophy of the user interface (visualization- or document-centric). We classified the types of territorial behavior exhibited in terms of how the users interacted with information on the display (integrated or independent workspaces). Next, we examined how territorial behavior impacted the common ground between the pairs of users. Finally, we offer design suggestions for building future co-located collaborative visual analytics tools for use on large, high-resolution vertical displays. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In a world of widespread information access, information can overwhelm collaborators, even with visualizations to help. We extend prior work to study the effect of shared information on collaboration. We analyzed the success and discussion process of remote pairs trying to identify a serial killer in multiple crime cases. Each partner had half of the evidence, or each partner had all the available evidence. Pairs also used one of three tools: spreadsheet only (control condition), unshared visualizations, or shared visualization. Visualizations improved analysis over the control condition but this improvement depended on how much evidence each partner had. When each partner possessed all the evidence with visualizations, discussion flagged and pairs showed evidence of more confirmation bias. They discussed fewer hypotheses and persisted on the wrong hypothesis. We discuss the possible reasons for this phenomenon and implications for design of remote collaboration systems to incorporate awareness of intermediate processes important to collaborative success.},

@article{Isenberg2009b,
abstract = {Many real-world analysis tasks can benefit from the combined efforts of a group of people. Past research has shown that to design visualizations for collaborative visual analytics tasks, we need to support both individual as well as joint analysis activities. We present Cambiera, a tabletop visual analytics tool that supports individual and collaborative information foraging activities in large text document collections. We define collaborative brushing and linking as an awareness mechanism that enables analysts to follow their own hypotheses during collaborative sessions while still remaining aware of the group's activities. With Cambiera, users are able to collaboratively search through documents, maintaining awareness of each others' work and building on each others' findings.},
