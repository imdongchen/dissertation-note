@article{Wu2013i,
abstract = {This paper reports two pieces of work, emphasizing the design process, taking the perspective from collaborative geospatial planning in emergency management. In the literature review part, the paper discusses collaboration vs. individual, public vs. private workspace, and sense-making theory, followed by discussion about activity awareness. Then the paper discusses about information visualization, and specifically, geo-visualization with map as centric. Next the paper lists seven design rational based on previous field study. In part four, the paper briefly explains the structure of the system and human evaluation. The second piece of work is a modification based on previous work and change to java-based prototype to web-based, and the paper discribes another set of evaluation. In the discussion part, the paper summarizes four design guidelines for geo-collaborative systems.},

Group activity awareness;
Personal {\&} public workspace;

Team cognition is different from individual cognition because it requires communication;
Team communication can be facilitated through channels of communication in which participants' actions relative to task-relevant objects are public;
Sense-making theory: top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid;
Compared to ftf, collaborative visualization increases content sharing, improves process of sharing, and promotes group performance.},
