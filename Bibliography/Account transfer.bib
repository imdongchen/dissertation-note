abstract = {The research reported here integrates computational, visual, and cartographic methods to develop a geovisual analytic approach for exploring and understanding spatio-temporal and multivariate patterns. The developed methodology and tools can help analysts investigate complex patterns across multivariate, spatial, and temporal dimensions via clustering, sorting, and visualization. Specifically, the approach involves a self-organizing map, a parallel coordinate plot, several forms of reorderable matrices (including several ordering methods), a geographic small multiple display, and a 2-dimensional cartographic color design method. The coupling among these methods leverages their independent strengths and facilitates a visual exploration of patterns that are difficult to discover otherwise. The visualization system we developed supports overview of complex patterns and, through a variety of interactions, enables users to focus on specific patterns and examine detailed views. We demonstrate the system with an application to the IEEE InfoVis 2005 Contest data set, which contains time-varying, geographically referenced, and multivariate data for technology companies in the US.},

Different from other experimental systems(GeoSpace, MIT Voyager) which took a technology-centric view on interface technology requred to support a multimodal interface to a map, their system DAVE{\_}G follows a human-centered approach. This can be seen from their method "Cognitive Systems Engineering" which elicits opinion from experts in real management processes.


The system is also domain oriented. It is designed specifically for emergency response, and to be more exactly, flood evacuation.

Three challenges are proposed in coping with geographic information uncertainty. 1. determining the current involvement of uncertainty at different stages in the decision cycle; 2. identifying the many forms of uncertainty; 3. understanding the influence of these forms on the use of geographic information.


MacEachren et al. (2005) proposed a typology of 9 uncertainty categories.


This paper uses a method called "focus group" to investigate qualitatively the influence of geographic information uncertainty. A focus group is a method of research that utilizes group discussion to solicit ideas and feedbacks about a concept or product. The paper organized a goup of floodplain experts to discuss around their experience with uncertainty and analyzed their feedback.},

annote = {Deliberation refers to a form of public discourse where interested community and stakeholders communite to identify goals and explore solutions. And Geodeliberation adds spatial emphasis to traditional deliberation. Geodeliberation and spatial analysis are two different aspects of GIS and require different functions and systems. 


A conceptual model of deliberative dialogue is proposed, consisting of five phases


Geospatial annotations are used to represent and structure the artifacts of geodeliberation. 


Annotations are linked with geometry on map and other referential annotations. The linking of annotations through their references from directional trees (SpaceTree), which can be used for visualization by threads of deliberative dialogues around an issue. 


GeoDeliberator is built following GeoDAT. It is C/S architectured, with Ext JS and Openlayers as client, and ASP.NET as server, and PostGIS as database.


Problem: are annotations linked automatically?


It seems the only support of GIS in the deliberative dialogue is display of location. More spatial analysis?},

annote = {People use GIS with vague and implicit spatial concepts. To understand these concepts, shared knowledge of context within which the concepts are used are needed. The context includes:
1. the task (people use GIS most in domain task, for a certain purpose)
2. the spatial context and situation
3. the background of the user (knowledge, experiences and preferences). 


The auther solves the problem with a collaborative dialogue approach. Here the "collaborative" refers to collaboration between human and GIS. The user has solid knowledge of 1st and 3rd context while the system knows 2nd context better. By sharing the knowledge along the dialogue discourse, common concepts are built between human and GIS. 


The system will automatically decide what contextual information is missing (invoking schemas stored in its knowledge-base) and initial a subdialogue itself. "SharedPlan" theory of multi-agent collaboration is adopted to model the mental attitudes for an agent to participate in a collaborative discourse. It is said that with this model, the system is able to adapt to users with different levels of contextual knowledge.},

Two points are highlighted: "sensemaking" and mobile context. Review on the two point points are conducted. 


Sensemaking involves top-down and bottom-up approaches, with "why" and "how" respectively. Also, instant cognitive and prior knowledge and experience are essential to sensemaking.


Visual analytics in mobile context currently only focus on information collection and communication, and location is generally the only input. The author points out that context information (loci (a locatio with people's sense what they can do in that place), people, event) should be provided, in order to help people learn the environment.


A sensemaking framework is proposed, with two interactive loops: a human sensemaking loop and a computational loop. 


Finally, theoretical design guidelines for mobile visual analytics are put forward},

In 1945 VAnnevar Bush published an article dealing with massive information. After World War II followed the a scientific and technical revolution which produced "information explosion" around 1963.Support from the government developed information science.


nature of "information" 
Learn the nature of information from its manifestations, behaviors and effects.Information can be viewed in three senses, in broader sequence:


Narrow: the property of a message which can be estimated by probability. Like uncertainty in information theory by Shannon.Adopted by system-oriented information science.


Broader: cognitive processing and understanding.


Broadest: not only messages and that cognitively processed, but also context(situation, task, problem). This sense is considered in information science.




Structure in terms of problems addressed


Two clusters: basic and applied clusters are there. 
The key problem to address is the interface between people and literature.




Evolutionary trends in IR
First proposed in 1951 by Calvin Mooers.The research is divided into two lines: system oriented and human-centered.
