abstract = {The challenge presented by ambient intelligence and pervasive computing is an environment within which computing artifacts become seamlessly merged into our surroundings, whereby interaction with such artifacts becomes intuitive and unobtrusive, where the devices become sensitive to the presence of people and are imbued with the ability to anticipate and service the individual needs of each and every user. In this paper, we present Gulliver's Genie, an archetypical ubiquitous computing application. Gulliver's Genie embraces three central constructs; those of agency, mobility and adaptivity. The architecture adopts a Multi-Agent Systems metaphor whereby agents manage and maintain a context within which mobile users exist and, based upon this context, seeks to adapt and personalize content based upon perceived individual user needs. Agents are mobile and may migrate to or from environmental artifacts reflecting their computational constraints.},

abstract = {As the development of internet and spatial information technology, clients' demands becoming more and more varied. However, as the service model of present map system is inflexible and fixed, it cannot adapt to diversified clients' demands, different types of devices and user scenarios. Intelligent map service takes adaptive geo-database as its data engine, provides effective, integrated and flexible data organization modes, automatically adjusts map content, map symbols, representation and data transfer mode, etc. Through multi-level storage and thematic data organizing, and analyzing user tasks and constantly changing scenarios, thus the system can serve the individualization and intellectualization of maps. Based on relative researches and the theory of adaptive system, intelligent map service and adaptive geo-database are introduced to form an intelligent map service platform which is self-adaptive, self-adjustive and self-organizational. It can automatically organize data, recommend information and provide intelligent map services, according to different users' requirements, map generation and application environment.},

Next, it sketches a couple of hypothetical pervasive computing scenarios, and uses them to identify key capabilities missing from today's systems.

abstract = {Recommendation systems have found their ways into many on-line web applications, e.g., product recommendation on Amazon and movie recommendation on Netflix. Particularly, collaborative filtering techniques have been widely used in these systems to personalize the recommendations according to the needs and tastes of users. In this paper, we apply collaborative filtering in spatial object recommendation which is essential in many location based services. Due to the large number of spatial objects and participating users, using collaborative filtering to obtain recommendations for a particular user can be very expensive. However, we observe that users tend to have affinity for some regions and argue that using users with similar regional bias in recommendation may help in reducing the search space of similar users. Thus, we propose two techniques, namely, Access Minimum Bounding Rectangle Overlapped Area (AMBROA) and Grid Division Cosine Similarity (GDCS), to form regions of interests that represent user location interests and activities and to find users with local access similarity to facilitate effective spatial object recommendation. We conduct an extensive performance evaluation to validate our ideas. Evaluation result demonstrates the superiority of our proposal over the conventional approach.},

abstract = {Significant interaction challenges arise in both developing and using interactive map applications. Users encounter problems of information overload in using interactive maps to complete tasks. This is further exacerbated by device limitations and interaction constraints in increasingly popular mobile platforms. Application developers must then address restrictions related to screen size and limited bandwidth in order to effectively display maps on mobile devices. In order to address issues of user information overload and application efficiency in interactive map applications, we have developed a novel approach for delivering personalized vector maps. Ongoing task interactions between users and maps are monitored and captured implicitly in order to infer individual and group preferences related to specific map feature content. Personalized interactive maps that contain spatial feature content tailored specifically to users' individual preferences are then generated. Our approach addresses spatial information overload by providing only the map information necessary and sufficient to suit user interaction preferences, thus simplifying the completion of tasks performed with interactive maps. In turn, tailoring map content to specific user preferences considerably reduces the size of vector data sets necessary to transmit and render maps on mobile devices. We have developed a geographic information system prototype, MAPPER (MAP PERsonalization), that implements our approach. Experimental evaluations show that the use of personalized maps helps users complete their tasks more efficiently and can reduce information overload.},

Comparison is made along two dimensions: context and adaption.

Context
1. scope. what contextual factors are considered?
2. representation. a) mechanisms for enhancing context reusability. b) level of abstraction at which context is represented.
3. acquisition. degree of automation: manual, automatic, or semi-automatic
4. mechanism. pull based or push-based

Adaptation
1. kind. what operations are done for adaption? e.g. filter content, change image resolution, interface change
2. subject. Level of the application to be adapted: content level, hyperbase level (navigation structure), presentation level (the layout of each page with user interaction facilities)

abstract = {Mass customization requires acquisition of customer preferences, which can be modeled with multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). Unfortunately current methods of acquiring MAUT weights and utility functions require too many queries. In Iona, the user is first queried for absolute/preferred constraints and categorical preferences to cull the product pool. Next Iona selects queries to maximally reduce the utility uncertainty of the remaining product choices. Implemented queries include stereotype membership and contexts (the purchase situation), which give probabilistic MAUT data modeled as ranges of weights. The usefulness of a query is based on the reduction in uncertainty (smaller range) weighted by the likelihood that the user belongs to a stereotype/context based on similarity to the current user model. Querying proceeds until the usefulness of the best query is below the threshold of user impatience. Finally integer programming is used to select the best product for the user.},

After an overview of existing recommendation systems within the geospatial domain, the novel approach adopted by RecoMap to produce such recommendations is described. A case study related to a university campus setting is used to outline an application of this technique. Details of the implementation and initial testing of this prototype are provided.},

Current LBS support spatial and attribute queries, such as finding the nearest Italian restaurant from the current location of the user, but they are limited in their capacity to evaluate decision alternatives and to consider individual decision-makers' user preferences. We suggest that LBS should provide personalized spatial decision support to their users. In a prototype implementation, we demonstrate how user preferences can be translated into parameters of a multi-criteria evaluation method. In particular, the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator allows users to specify a personal decision strategy. A traveler scenario investigating the influence of different types of users and different decision strategies on the outcome of the analysis serves as a case study.},

The GUIDE system has been built to overcome many of the limitations of the traditional information and navigation tools available to city visitors. For example, group-based tours are inherently inflexible with fixed starting times and fixed durations and (like most guidebooks) are constrained by the need to satisfy the interests of the majority rather than the specific interests of individuals. Following a period of requirements capture, involving experts in the field of tourism, we developed and installed a system for use by visitors to Lancaster. The system combines mobile computing technologies with a wireless infrastructure to present city visitors with information tailored to both their personal and environmental contexts. In this paper we present an evaluation of GUIDE, focusing on the quality of the visitor's experience when using the system.},

Reaching this stage has been the culmination of a number of distinct research efforts. In more detail, the development of GUIDE has involved: capturing a real set of application requirements, investigating the properties of a cell-based wireless communications technology in a built-up environment and deploying a network based on this technology around the city, designing and populating an information model to represent attractions and key buildings within the city, prototyping the development of a distributed application running across portable GUIDE units and stationary cell-servers and finally, evaluating the entire system during an extensive field-trial study.
