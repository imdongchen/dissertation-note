abstract = {Although ths paper is composed for virtual organization, which has some special characteristics, most theories it mentions can be applied to general collaboration. The paper lists 24 facets of organizational effectiveness which are categorized into three high-level arenas of organizational function - awareness, problem solving, and sense of community. In detail, the paper talks about common ground and collective efficacy, inclusive problems solving, commitment and identification, and constructive dissent and conflict. The paper also addresses practice-based theory and patterns-based theory, which is unclear to me. Finally the paper reviews two projects in terms of patterns of effective VOs. To me, the greatest value of the paper is the description of some concepts, such as common ground, sense of community, and pattern.},

@article{Putnam1995c,
abstract = {The paper first discusses the significance of civic engagement, that it powerfully influences the quality of public life and performance of social institutions. Then it discusses the concept of "social capital", which refers to features of social organizations such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit, and how social capital could improve the performance of community. Then the paper lists some statistics showing the declining of civic engagement from 1970s to 1990s. However, as this paper was written in 1995, the evidence it refers is not so convincing any longer. The paper starts from research findings of decline of community and addresses the importance of community and explains why it's concerned with deliberation. The paper aims to address the question: how does deliberative civic engagement contribute to communty capacity building? First the author explains the concept of community and community capacity, and employs the community capacity-building framework by Robert Chaskin. The framework identifies four component characteristics of community capacity: 1) a sense of community, 2) commitment to community among its members, 3) the ability to solve problems, 4) access to resources, as well as four specific strategies for building community capacity: 1) leadership development, 2) organizational development, 3) community organizing, and 4) organizational collaboration. Then the paper argues how deliberation could contribute to these aspects of community capacity building by listing empirical evidence. In the end, the paper admits that although there is evidence that deliberation does have a positive effect on communities, what exactly makes these effects happen remains unclear.},
