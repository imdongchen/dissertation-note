@inproceedings{Schmidt2002,
abstract = {The paper discusses the definition of awaareness in CSCW. The term "awareness" is found ambiguous and has been used in various ways. For instance, awareness was initially adopted to denote practices through which cooperative activities are tacitly and unobtrusively aligned and integrated, but are now sometimes used to conceptualize the use of instant messaging system. The term is also often used with different adjectives, e.g. "general awareness", "collaborative awareness" "peripheral awareness" "background awareness" "passive awareness" "reciprocal awareness" "mutual awareness" "workspace awareness", etc. The first question to address with is of what cooperative actors are supposedly aware, or aware of what? The paper summarizes that it is aware of social context, and may lead to "informal interaction" and "a shared culture". Awareness is also used to denote those practices through which actors tacitly and seamlessly align and integrate their distributed and yet interdependent activities. The paper also distinguishes the difference between awareness and attention, or focus. Awareness is gathered "passively", while other workplace activities progress. Finally the paper talks about how awareness is gained so effortlessly without interrupting the current line of work. On the one hand, actors "monitor" the activities of their colleagues in the setting which doesn't require a response from them. On the other hand, actors display their activities that might be relevant to their colleagues. Besides, actors can gain awareness effortless because the world is "meaningful" to them.},
annote = {The term ‘awareness' here denotes taking heed of unfolding events and of possibly unfolding events; of things being done, of things done, and of things in need of being done; of developments within the joint effort that may be advantageous, detrimental, hazardous, etc. for one's own work; of occurrences that makes one's own work more urgent or less so, that require action or inaction, that necessitate changes to the intended course of action, etc. – all of it directly motivated by the actors' being interdependent in their work and hence by the unavoidable requirements of coordinating and integrating their various actions.},

@article{Bier2010,
abstract = {Software tools that make it easier for analysts to collaborate as a natural part of their work will lead to better analysis that is informed by more perspectives. We are interested to know if software tools can be designed that support collaboration even as they allow analysts to find documents and organize information (including evidence, schemas, and hypotheses). We have modified the Entity Workspace system, described previously, to test such designs. We have evaluated the resulting design in both a laboratory study and a study where it is situated with an analysis team. In both cases, effects on collaboration appear to be positive. Key aspects of the design include an evidence notebook optimized for organizing entities (rather than text characters), information structures that can be collapsed and expanded, visualization of evidence that emphasizes events and documents (rather than emphasizing the entity graph), and a notification system that finds entities of mutual interest to multiple analysts. Long-term tests suggest that this approach can support both top-down and bottom-up styles of analysis.},

@article{Carroll2006,
annote = {Critique the notion of knowledge in common in shared mental model. On one hand, the model dismisses the possibility of complementary knowledge--a participant does not need to know knowledge in other members, but knows what others know, the so-called ‘transactive memory'. On the other hand, shared mental model is static, while group mental model keeps evolving as communication and interaction proceed. It is more important to know how collaborators identify knowledge in common and use knowledge to coordinate their activities. 
In p. 25 the paper explains the notion of ‘activity awareness'. The goal is to shift the focus on static shared concepts (knowledge) to dynamic shared activity. The term ‘activity' takes from Activity Theory, which puts human behavior in an organized and contextualized framework.
The paper discusses four facets of activity awareness: common ground (Clark, 1996), community of practice (Wenger et al. 2002), social capital (Coleman, 1988), and human development (Vygotsky, 1978). It uses a hypothetical emergency management scenario (forest fire fighters).
Finally, the paper lists examples of design implications. One principle is that activity awareness should be supported with no extra attention and effort.},

@article{Dourish1992,
abstract = {Awareness of individual and group activities is critical to successful collaboration and is commonly supported in CSCW systems by active, information generation mechanisms separate from the shared workspace. These mechanisms penalise information providers, presuppose relevance to the recipient, and make access difficult. We discuss a study of shared editor use which suggests that awareness information provided and exploited through the shared workspace, smoothly between close and loose collaboration, passively allows users to move and to assign and coordinate work dynamically. Passive awareness mechanisms promise effective support for collaboration requiring this sort of behaviour, whilst avoiding problems with active approaches.},
