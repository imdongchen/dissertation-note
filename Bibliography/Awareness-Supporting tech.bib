@inproceedings{Hill2004c,
abstract = {Group awareness is an important part of synchronous collaboration, and support for group awareness can greatly improve groupware usability. However, it is still difficult to build groupware that supports group awareness. To address this problem, we have developed the Multi-User Awareness UI toolkit (MAUI) toolkit, a Java toolkit with a broad suite of awareness-enhanced UI components. The toolkit contains both extensions of standard Swing widgets, and groupware-specific components such as telepointers. All components have added functionality for collecting, distributing, and visualizing group awareness information. The toolkit packages components as JavaBeans, allowing wide code reuse, easy integration with IDEs, and drag-and-drop creation of working group-aware interfaces. The toolkit provides the first ever set of UI widgets that are truly collaboration-aware, and provides them in a way that greatly simplifies the construction and testing of rich groupware interfaces.},

@article{Werfel2014b,
abstract = {Fast slip flow was reported for water inside the interlayer gallery between graphene layers or carbon nanotubes. We report here that this flow rate enhancement (over two orders) breaks down with the presence of chemical functionalization and relaxation of the nanoconfinement in graphene oxides. Molecular dynamics simulation results show that hydrodynamics applies in this circumstance, even at length scales down to nanometers. However, corrections on the slip boundary condition and viscosity of nanoconfined flow must be included to make quantitative predictions. These results were discussed with structural characteristics of the liquid water and hydrogen bond networks.},
