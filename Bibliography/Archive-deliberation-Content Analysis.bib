abstract = {The paper first discusses the definition of "deliberation". Then it identifies six elements of deliberation to code, including reasoned opinion expression, sourcing, equality, to/off topic, disagreement, and engagement. For each element, the paper describes a practical way to capture. Finally the author applies this coding scheme to a case study and makes a discussion on the coding result},
