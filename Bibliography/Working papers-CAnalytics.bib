@article{Carroll2009i,
abstract = {This paper argues to establish and maintain asynchronous awareness from the standpoint of designing with a positive lens, which means to develop technology-mediated collaboration that exceeds FTF collaboration, in constrast with the deficit-oriented problem-solving design method. The paper explains four facets of acitivity awareness, including common ground, CoPs, social capital, and human development. The paper draws from three projects indicating how they have been designed to support these facets.},
