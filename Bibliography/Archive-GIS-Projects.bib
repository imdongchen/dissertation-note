The paper reviews some efforts to search for a conceptual framework for GIS functions, including map algebra by Tomlin [2], 6-category taxonomy on GIS database by Goodchild [10]. The paper describes three high-level strategies to simplify the organization of GIS functions: by implicit invocation, by removing the need to interact with low-level components of GIS representation, and by regarding analysis as a set of transformations of geodatabase. Finally, the paper suggests referring to some textbooks for the conceptualization of GIS functions.},

abstract = {Spatial cognitive abilities play an important role in the use of GIS, although they have yet to be examined in a controlled experimental setting. This study aimed to develop an experimental design which measures spatial cognitive abilities in the use of GIS, specifically the map overlay operation. Subjects (n = 134) received three map overlay tests in which they were given two of the following: input map layers, logical operator(s), or output map layer(s). Subjects were required to select the correct logical operator for Test 1, to select the correct output map layer for Test 2, and to select the correct input map layers for Test 3. Each test contained a total of 16 questions, based on a 4 (‘and', ‘or', ‘xor', ‘not' operators) × 2 (one or two polygons per map layer) × 2 (three or five polygon edges) factorial design. Results indicated a significant main effect of logical operators and number of polygons on performance; however, there was no effect of the number of polygon edges on performance. Significant two-way interactions revealed an effect of the number of polygon edges and the number of polygons using various logical operators on performance. In addition, performance was not significantly different between males and females or between GIS users and non-users. Overall, results show that map overlays in which a visual correspondence can be made between the same polygons in the input and output map layers are cognitively less demanding than map overlays in which the shape of the polygons have been radically transformed between the input and output map layers. This study helps further develop our understanding of the spatial cognitive abilities which are required in the use of GIS, and whether certain sub-populations differ in these cognitive abilities. These results may contribute to more effective and efficient GIS teaching and interface design by taking into account individual spatial cognitive abilities.},

abstract = {In user interface design a common pitfall is to use the technical properties of the device as basis for the design, which easily causes a user interface to become too complicated and hard to use. Also, the great development in the area of different hand-held terminal devices has set new requirements for user interfaces: screen sizes of devices are very small, advanced I/O devices are used instead of ordinary mouse and keyboard and the operating environment of the devices differs significantly from familiar PCs and laptops. However, governmental and in particular military communications systems often trail behind this development. To be able to overcome the aforementioned challenges and take usability of governmental communication systems to a new level, a new approach is needed. This paper covers user-centered design of graphical user interfaces to advanced communication devices designed to be used in challenging environment, e.g., in moving vehicles and outdoors in any season, and to support devices with limited screen size and touch screen technology. We also introduce a proof-of-concept implementation and show through a user test that general principles introduced in the paper can easily be applied to a specialized communication device.},

abstract = {Working with three domain specialists we investigate human-centered approaches to geovisualization following an ISO13407 taxonomy covering context of use, requirements and early stages of design. Our case study, undertaken over three years, draws attention to repeating trends: that generic approaches fail to elicit adequate requirements for geovis application design; that the use of real data is key to understanding needs and possibilities; that trust and knowledge must be built and developed with collaborators. These processes take time but modified human-centred approaches can be effective. A scenario developed through contextual inquiry but supplemented with domain data and graphics is useful to geovis designers. Wireframe, paper and digital prototypes enable successful communication between specialist and geovis domains when incorporating real and interesting data, prompting exploratory behaviour and eliciting previously unconsidered requirements. Paper prototypes are particularly successful at eliciting suggestions, especially for novel visualization. Enabling specialists to explore their data freely with a digital prototype is as effective as using a structured task protocol and is easier to administer. Autoethnography has potential for framing the design process. We conclude that a common understanding of context of use, domain data and visualization possibilities are essential to successful geovis design and develop as this progresses. HC approaches can make a significant contribution here. However, modified approaches, applied with flexibility, are most promising. We advise early, collaborative engagement with data – through simple, transient visual artefacts supported by data sketches and existing designs – before moving to successively more sophisticated data wireframes and data prototypes.},

@article{MacEachren2006b,
abstract = {Geospatial information is a fundamental component of many crisis management activities. However, current geospatial technologies do not support work by crisis management personnel, most of whom are not technology specialists—a key impediment is that the technologies require the user to learn the system's language . In addition, geospatial technologies are not ‘collaboration friendly'—they impede rather than facilitate group work. In this paper we address both issues by presenting (1) a theoretical framework for understanding the roles of visual mediation in map-supported human – human dialogues, and (2) a computational approach for enabling such roles in collaborative spatial decisionmaking contexts. Building upon our initial implementation of a map-mediated collaborative environment, the DAVE{\_}G system [a natural, multimodal, dialogue-enabled interface to geographical information systems (GIS)], we model human – GIS and human – GIS – human dialogues as complex visual-cognitive signification processes in which maps become dynamic facilitators. Using a scenario simulating two crisis managers dealing with a major nuclear release event, we demonstrate how visual display (in DAVE{\_}G) actively mediates human – human dialogue directed to situation assessment and action planning in real applications.},

abstract = {We deal about the design in human-centered computing. Problem solving often involves recognizing and fiddling with tacit assumptions. Such realization can often come from seeing things from new perspectives. Appreciating the human-centered perspective may offer some hope for enriching design's scientific foundations and for crafting new and better approaches to it. Certainly this suggests a constraint on or a goal for design, but how do we go from such statements to actual designs that accomplish the stated goals? We approach this class of question by considering the origins of and historical influences on the notion of design, then by considering the assumptions underlying our modern conception of design in light of the principles of human-centered computing.},
