The classes are evaluation of groupware, description of work situations, hypothesis testing, biblio- graphic research, and papers with no empirical research. We show that the field is in constant change, that the pro- portions of papers in these different categories have been changing in these 6 years, and that for the evaluation pa- pers, the results by Pinelle and Gutwin do not carry for the 1998-2004 period.},

abstract = {A functional design of an interactive Cyber-Physical System (CPS) for people with disabilities and frail elderly people is introduced as an effective method of proactive service in smart space. The scenario-based functional design of CPS has been motivated by open issues, concepts, and framework architecture for resolving inter space interaction issues caused by changes in users' location and environment which is one of key issues in adjusting and re-setting smart environments for the target population. The interactive CPS will be experiencing users' moving around smart spaces as Activities of Daily Living (ADL). When the prospective users want to have their service anywhere they visit in the smart spaces, the interactive CPS will have serial interactions to acquire resources for providing services in continuous and streamlined fashion. These interactions between each smart space provide users with services they need in a new location, where there are no prior settings and where the other users might already occupied and being served.},

abstract = {Working with three domain specialists we investigate human-centered approaches to geovisualization following an ISO13407 taxonomy covering context of use, requirements and early stages of design. Our case study, undertaken over three years, draws attention to repeating trends: that generic approaches fail to elicit adequate requirements for geovis application design; that the use of real data is key to understanding needs and possibilities; that trust and knowledge must be built and developed with collaborators. These processes take time but modified human-centred approaches can be effective. A scenario developed through contextual inquiry but supplemented with domain data and graphics is useful to geovis designers. Wireframe, paper and digital prototypes enable successful communication between specialist and geovis domains when incorporating real and interesting data, prompting exploratory behaviour and eliciting previously unconsidered requirements. Paper prototypes are particularly successful at eliciting suggestions, especially for novel visualization. Enabling specialists to explore their data freely with a digital prototype is as effective as using a structured task protocol and is easier to administer. Autoethnography has potential for framing the design process. We conclude that a common understanding of context of use, domain data and visualization possibilities are essential to successful geovis design and develop as this progresses. HC approaches can make a significant contribution here. However, modified approaches, applied with flexibility, are most promising. We advise early, collaborative engagement with data {\&}{\#}8211; through simple, transient visual artefacts supported by data sketches and existing designs {\&}{\#}8211; before moving to successively more sophisticated data wireframes and data prototypes.},

To address this need we introduce value scenarios, an extension of scenario-based design which can support envisioning the systemic effects of new technologies. We identify and describe five key elements of value scenarios; stakeholders, pervasiveness, time, systemic effects, and value implications. We provide two examples of value scenarios, which draw from our current work on urban simulation and human-robotic interaction . We conclude with suggestions for how value scenarios might be used by others.},

abstract = {This paper reflects on the uses of different forms of storytelling in the design and implementation of an experience prototype for a Museum exhibition about the medieval historian Jean Froissart. Concept designs developed during interdisciplinary design workshops were captured as pastiche scenarios for further discussions. Content was created using actors who recorded readings from Froissart's chronicles and then created dramatic or comic improvisations a round the same stories. A prototype was developed where users set levels for different kinds of content and wore a badge which enabled the system to present a personalised selection of material. The prototype was trialled with visitors to a live Froissart exhibit at the Leeds Royal Armouries. Observations and interviews were made over a three-day period and responses were overall enthusiastic. The paper argues that understandings of story are becoming central to experience centered design.},

To examine this proposition, 43 participants, from four stakeholder groups (homeless young people, service providers, police officers, and community members), were asked to consider how homeless young people could use mobile phones to keep safe. Participants were asked to express their knowledge for place-based safety and to envision how mobile phones might be used to improve safety. Detailed analysis of the resulting data, which included value sketches, written value scenarios, and semi-structured discussion, led to specific design opportunities, related to values (e.g., supporting trust and desire to help others), function (e.g., documenting harms for future purposes), and form (e.g., leveraging social expectations for how mobile phones can be used to influence behavior). Together, these findings bound a design space for how mobile phones can be used to manage unsafe situations.},

abstract = {Current GUI builders provide a design environment for user interfaces that target either a single type or fixed set of devices, and provide little support for scenarios in which the user interface, or parts of it, are distributed over multiple devices. Distributed user interfaces have received increasing attention over the past years. There are different, often model-based, approaches that focus on technical issues. This paper presents XDStudio--a new GUI builder designed to support interactive development of cross-device web interfaces. XDStudio implements two complementary authoring modes with a focus on the design process of distributed user interfaces. First, simulated authoring allows designing for a multi-device environment on a single device by simulating other target devices. Second, on-device authoring allows the design process itself to be distributed over multiple devices, as design and development take place on the target devices themselves. To support interactive development for multi-device environments, where not all devices may be present at design and run-time, XDStudio supports switching between the two authoring modes, as well as between design and use modes, as required. This paper focuses on the design of XDStudio, and evaluates its support for two distribution scenarios.},

We developed and prototyped a future scenario with highly variable, real-time electricity prices due to a grid that mainly relies on renewables. We designed and deployed an agent-based interactive system that enables users to effectively operate the washing machine in this scenario. The system is used to book timeslots of washing machine use so that the agent can help to minimize the cost of a wash by charging a battery at times when electricity is cheap. We carried out a deployment in 10 households in order to uncover the socio-technical challenges around integrating new technologies into everyday routines. The findings reveal tensions that arise when deploying a rationalistic system to manage contingently and socially organized domestic practices. We discuss the trade-offs between utility and convenience inherent in smart grid applications; and illustrate how certain design choices position applications along this spectrum. Author},

In this paper, we explore how such building blocks might serve as interaction design patterns that enable design exploration and prototyping for human-robot interaction. To construct a pattern library, we observed human interactions across different scenarios and identified seven patterns, such as question-answer pairs. We then designed and implemented Interaction Blocks, a visual authoring environment that enabled prototyping of robot interactions using these patterns. Design sessions with designers and developers demonstrated the promise of using a pattern language for designing robot interactions, confirmed the usability of our authoring environment, and provided insights into future research on tools for human-robot interaction design.},

abstract = {Social networking sites ({\{}SNSs){\}} provide ambient awareness of the interests and activities of friends and relatives helping them sustain and strengthen their social ties. Older adults who are not adopting {\{}SNSs{\}} might however feel like outsiders within their own families who increasingly rely on these services to socialize. Previous research has shown that situated displays can provide appropriate interfaces for older adults to use digital services. In this paper we explore how situated displays can intuitively provide ambient awareness to strengthen the family social network of older adults. We designed and developed Tlatoque, a situated display, to seamlessly integrate older adults into the {\{}SNS{\}} used by their relatives. The results of a 21-week deployment study of an initial version of Tlatoque in one extended family showed that the older adult became more conscious of relatives' activities, which also enriched in-person encounters. However, relatives expected the older adult to reply to their posts in the {\{}SNS{\}} and Tlatoque lacked mechanisms for the older adult to provide feedback. We re-designed Tlatoque to incorporate means for enabling the older adult to share information back to the {\{}SNS.{\}} We conducted a second 21-week deployment study with another extended family to evaluate the use of this new version of the system. Our results indicate that the second design was successful in providing ambient awareness to the older adult as well as to her relatives. We conclude that situated displays that provide {\{}SNS{\}} services can assist the integration of older adults to their social network and contribute to enhance asymmetric relations between the older adult and younger relatives.},

We created a series of narrative fictions with embedded design concepts, and built low-fi prototype artifacts for directed storytelling sessions with twelve participants. We conclude with a discussion of findings regarding the opportunities to more effectively use narrative techniques and immersive storytelling to create valuable experiences between designers and users.},

abstract = {We introduce a design method for evolving a co-design space to support stakeholders untrained in design. Specifically, the purpose of the method is to expand and shape a co-design space so that stakeholders, acting as designers, focus not only on the form and function of a tool being envisioned but also on the social context of its use and values that lie with individuals, groups, and societies. The method introduces value sensitive stakeholder prompts and designer prompts into a co-design process, creating a particular kind of reflection-on-action cycle. The prompts provide a means for bringing empirical data on values and theoretical perspective into the co-design process. We present the method in terms of a general model, the Value Sensitive Action-Reflection Model; place the model within discourse on co-design spaces; and illustrate the model with a discussion of its application in a lo-fi prototyping activity around safety for homeless young people. We conclude with reflections on the model and method. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {Generating potential design ideas through ideation often benefits from the spontaneity of random ideas. Having potential users participate in this process can be beneficial, but is often difficult to implement. We present a new method for generating design ideas with potential users. The method uses scenarios with missing words, which potential users fill in to generate ideas for features and attributes of new technology designs, similar to the children's game of Mad Libs. We developed three different formats of DesignLibs, including 1) "Mad Libs-style": blanks presented before seeing the scenario, 2) "Fill-in-the-Blanks": blanks presented within the context of the scenario, and 3) "Q{\&}A": blanks presented as questions and answers. We found that Design-Libs generated a number of new ideas, with the Fill-in-the-Blanks method providing the highest ratings for usefulness, feasibility, and diversity of answers. All three formats provided equal ratings for creativity.},

abstract = {Social networking sites (SNS) help users sustain and strengthen ties with friends and relatives. However older adults who are less technically inclined individuals are often left aside these SNS felling as outsiders within their own family that uses this media to socialize. To assist these non-technical older adults we developed two ambient displays aimed at seamlessly integrate them into SNS. The first prototype, ePortrait, shows to older adults the photographs uploaded by their relatives in a SNS and the second prototype, eBowl, provides means to communicate their status through the manipulation of physical objects. The results of an evaluation shows that ambient displays are capable of monitoring older adults' context and provide them with continuous information about their social network in a subtle, peripheral and expressive manner. As a consequence, older adults use the information conveyed by such displays to enhance conversations with new topics helping them feel more integrated with their family.},

Envisioning, a characteristic future-oriented technique for design thinking, often features as significant part of our research processes in the field. This paper compares, contrasts and critiques the varied ways in which envisionings have been used within ubiquitous computing and traces their relationships to other, different envisionings, such as those of virtual reality. In unpacking envisioning, it argues primarily that envisioning should be foregrounded as a significant concern and interest within HCI. Foregrounding envisionings frequent mix of fiction, forecasting and extrapolation, the paper recommends changes in the way we read, interpret and use envisionings through taking into account issues such as context and intended audience.},
