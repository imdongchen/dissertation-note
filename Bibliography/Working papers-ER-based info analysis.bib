abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this survey research is twofold. First, to study and report the process that is commonly used to create and maintain a competitive intelligence (CI) program in organizations. And second, to provide an analysis of several emergent text mining, web mining and visualization-based CI tools, which are specific to collection and analysis of intelligence. Design/methodology/approach - A range of recently published research literature on CI processes, applications, tools and technologies to collect and analyze competitive information within organizations is reviewed to explore their current state, issues and challenges learned from their practice. Findings - The paper provides executive decision makers and strategic managers a better understanding of what methods are available and appropriate to the decisions they must make and the steps involved in CI undertaking. Originality/value - The findings of this research provide the managers of CI programs a context for understanding which tools and techniques are better suited to their specific types of problems; and help them develop and evaluate a usable set of tools and best practices to apply to their industry. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

We present also briefly two SOA-based tools for enabling our approach: Uncle-Share is a gadget that provides annotation-based access control for bookmarks and uses CoVoc for annotating collaborative relationships. Who-With-Whom uses also CoVoc and visualizes extended social networks in order to help users to select the appropriate contacts to grant access to resources.},

@misc{Bobrow2005a,
abstract = {Intelligence analysis requires detecting and exploiting patterns hidden in complex data. When the critical aspects of a data set can be effectively visually presented, displays become powerful tools by harnessing the pattern-recognition capabilities of human vision. To this end, shape, color, and interactive techniques are widely utilized in intelligence displays. Unfortunately, the volume and complexity of intelligence data has outstripped our ability to visualize that data. Under the ARDA GI2Vis program we have overcome this limit with a broad new class of visualization techniques based on the innate human ability to perceive motion. These “kinetic” visualizations encode attributes of data using motion, and use motion to query for and highlight patterns in intelligence data. By conveying complex data directly to the pre-attentive perceptual system, these displays require less time and cognitive effort to detect patterns than purely static displays. In this work we describe kinetic displays for network analysis, detection of patterns and correlations across multiple displays of geospatially registered event data, and visualization of structures in high-dimensional data sets such as imagery-derived intelligence. We also present the theoretical basis for this work, and briefly describe the results of published experiments demonstrating the utility of kinetic displays.},

@inproceedings{Correndo2007a,
abstract = {The fast growth and spread of Web 2.0 environments have demonstrated the great willingness of general Web users to contribute and share various type of content and information. Many very successful web sites currently exist which thrive on the wisdom of the crowd, where web users in general are the sole data providers and curators. The Semantic Web calls for knowledge to be semantically represented using ontologies to allow for better access and sharing of data. However, constructing ontologies collaboratively is not well supported by most existing ontology and knowledge-base editing tools. This has resulted in the recent emergence of a new range of collaborative ontology construction tools with the aim of integrating some Web 2.0 features into the process of structured knowledge construction. This paper provides a survey of the start of the art of these tools, and highlights their significant features and capabilities.},
