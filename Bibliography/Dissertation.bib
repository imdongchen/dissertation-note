abstract = {The results of a multi-year research program to identify the factors associated with variations in subjective workload within and between different types of tasks are reviewed. Subjective evaluations of 10 workload-related factors were obtained from 16 different experiments. The experimental tasks included simple cognitive and manual control tasks, complex laboratory and supervisory control tasks, and aircraft simulation. Task-, behavior-, and subject-related correlates of subjective workload experiences varied as a function of difficulty manipulations within experiments, different sources of workload between experiments, and individual differences in workload definition. A multi-dimensional rating scale is proposed in which information about the magnitude and sources of six workload-related factors are combined to derive a sensitive and reliable estimate of workload. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The development of new interface tools for intelligence analysis re-quires a thorough knowledge of the analytical process, and a com-prehensive understanding of analyst activities that can best benefit from intelligent user interface technology. However, due to the se-cretive nature of the domain, there have been relatively few public studies examining analyst behavior. In this paper, we present the results from a user study designed to explore the ways in which analysts gather and process information. The study asked three subjects to perform two different analytical tasks. The tasks were designed to gather observations from two points in the analytical process: (1) the beginning of an investigation, where little context is available, and (2) the middle stages of the analytical process, where there can be significant context based on gathered evidence and developed target models. We discuss both the study methodol-ogy and key results. Our results include observations of how ana-lysts formulate information requests and process the results.},

abstract = {Maintaining an awareness of collaborators' actions is critical during collaborative work, including during collaborative visualization activities. Particularly when collaborators are located at a distance, it is important to know what everyone is working on in order to avoid duplication of effort, share relevant results in a timely manner and build upon each other's results. Can a person's brushing actions provide an indication of their queries and interests in a data set? Can these actions be revealed to a collaborator without substantially disrupting their own independent work? We designed a study to answer these questions in the context of distributed collaborative visualization of tabular data. Participants in our study worked independently to answer questions about a tabular data set, while simultaneously viewing brushing actions of a fictitious collaborator, shown directly within a shared workspace. We compared three methods of presenting the collaborator's actions: brushing {\&} linking (i.e. highlighting exactly what the collaborator would see), selection (i.e. showing only a selected item), and persistent selection (i.e. showing only selected items but having them persist for some time). Our results demonstrated that persistent selection enabled some awareness of the collaborator's activities while causing minimal interference with independent work. Other techniques were less effective at providing awareness, and brushing {\&} linking caused substantial interference. These findings suggest promise for the idea of exploiting natural brushing actions to provide awareness in collaborative work.},

abstract = {Software tools that make it easier for analysts to collaborate as a natural part of their work will lead to better analysis that is informed by more perspectives. We are interested to know if software tools can be designed that support collaboration even as they allow analysts to find documents and organize information (including evidence, schemas, and hypotheses). We have modified the Entity Workspace system, described previously, to test such designs. We have evaluated the resulting design in both a laboratory study and a study where it is situated with an analysis team. In both cases, effects on collaboration appear to be positive. Key aspects of the design include an evidence notebook optimized for organizing entities (rather than text characters), information structures that can be collapsed and expanded, visualization of evidence that emphasizes events and documents (rather than emphasizing the entity graph), and a notification system that finds entities of mutual interest to multiple analysts. Long-term tests suggest that this approach can support both top-down and bottom-up styles of analysis.},

abstract = {Asynchronous collaborative analysis is important in many fields, but information sharing can be a bottleneck. Tools for annotating, organizing, and summarizing information can help, but their value will likely depend on the accuracy of teammates' information. To document this claim, two experiments examined participants' performance on a complex detective task when they asynchronously received information from a teammate in a collaboration tool or received no such information. We found that receiving a progress report containing accurate information was associated with improved performance (vs. no information shared in a tool) but worse performance when the information was inaccurate. Teammates were evaluated as helpful even when they were not. Our findings point to a phenomenon of teammate inaccuracy blindness that arises when teammates provide inaccurate information. We propose some strategies for helping collaborators avoid or lessen this effect.},

abstract = {The increasing scale and availability of digital data provides an extraordinary resource for informing public policy, scientific discovery, business strategy, and even our personal lives. To get the most out of such data, however, users must be able to make sense of it: to pursue questions, uncover patterns of interest, and identify (and potentially correct) errors. In concert with data-management systems and statistical algorithms, analysis requires contextualized human judgments regarding the domain- specific significance of the clusters, trends, and outliers discovered in data. Visualization provides a powerful means of making sense of data. By mapping data attributes to visual properties such as position, size, shape, and color, visualization designers leverage perceptual skills to help users discern and interpret patterns within data.11 A single image, however, typically provides answers to, at best, a handful of questions. Instead, visual analysis typically progresses in an iterative process of view creation, exploration, and refinement. Meaningful analysis consists of repeated explorations as users develop insights about significant relationships, domain-specific contextual influences, and causal patterns. Confusing widgets, complex dialog boxes, hidden operations, incomprehensible displays, or slow response times can limit the range and depth of topics considered and may curtail thorough deliberation and introduce errors. To be most effective, visual analytics tools must support the fluent and flexible use of visualizations at rates resonant with the pace of human thought. The goal of this article is to assist designers, researchers, professional analysts, procurement officers, educators, and students in evaluating and creating visual analysis tools. We present a taxonomy of interactive dynamics that contribute to successful analytic dialogues. The},

A few frameworks and taxonomies of Infovis interaction techniques exist, but they typically focus on low-level operations and do not address the variety of benefits interaction provides. After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.},

abstract = {The paper discusses the definition of awaareness in CSCW. The term "awareness" is found ambiguous and has been used in various ways. For instance, awareness was initially adopted to denote practices through which cooperative activities are tacitly and unobtrusively aligned and integrated, but are now sometimes used to conceptualize the use of instant messaging system. The term is also often used with different adjectives, e.g. "general awareness", "collaborative awareness" "peripheral awareness" "background awareness" "passive awareness" "reciprocal awareness" "mutual awareness" "workspace awareness", etc. The first question to address with is of what cooperative actors are supposedly aware, or aware of what? The paper summarizes that it is aware of social context, and may lead to "informal interaction" and "a shared culture". Awareness is also used to denote those practices through which actors tacitly and seamlessly align and integrate their distributed and yet interdependent activities. The paper also distinguishes the difference between awareness and attention, or focus. Awareness is gathered "passively", while other workplace activities progress. Finally the paper talks about how awareness is gained so effortlessly without interrupting the current line of work. On the one hand, actors "monitor" the activities of their colleagues in the setting which doesn't require a response from them. On the other hand, actors display their activities that might be relevant to their colleagues. Besides, actors can gain awareness effortless because the world is "meaningful" to them.},

The classes are evaluation of groupware, description of work situations, hypothesis testing, biblio- graphic research, and papers with no empirical research. We show that the field is in constant change, that the pro- portions of papers in these different categories have been changing in these 6 years, and that for the evaluation pa- pers, the results by Pinelle and Gutwin do not carry for the 1998-2004 period.},

abstract = {An effective way to learn computer programming is to sit side-by-side in front of the same computer with a tutor or peer, write code together, and then discuss what happens as the code executes. To bring this kind of in-person interaction to an online setting, we have developed Codechella, a multi-user Webbased program visualization system that enables multiple people to collaboratively write code together, explore an automaticallygenerated visualization of its execution state using multiple mouse cursors, and chat via an embedded text box. In nine months of live deployment on an educational website – www.pythontutor.com – people from 296 cities across 40 countries participated in 299 Codechella sessions for both tutoring and collaborative learning. 57{\%} of sessions connected participants from different cities, and 12{\%} from different countries. Participants actively engaged with the program visualizations while chatting, showed affective exchanges such as encouragement and banter, and indicated signs of learning at the lower three levels of Bloom's taxonomy: remembering, understanding, and applying knowledge.},

abstract = {Personal communication between User-Centered Design (UCD) specialists and developers is important for communicating user needs and design solutions in agile development. In distributed projects where opportunities for personal communication are limited, the design documentation is an important surrogate. This study has investigated the perceived effectiveness of boundary objects in a distributed agile team, and their role in communicating target user needs. Six in-depth interviews with UCD specialists showed that the boundary objects rarely communicate underlying needs of the users but rather focus on interaction with the system that is being developed. The used boundary objects also do not work as stand-alone deliverables; they need to be explained and elaborated. Making the boundary objects comprehensive enough to be stand-alone is seen as too time consuming and not worth the effort. For agile projects with distributed teams, this creates hand-over and follow-up problems.},

annote = {Critique the notion of knowledge in common in shared mental model. On one hand, the model dismisses the possibility of complementary knowledge--a participant does not need to know knowledge in other members, but knows what others know, the so-called ‘transactive memory'. On the other hand, shared mental model is static, while group mental model keeps evolving as communication and interaction proceed. It is more important to know how collaborators identify knowledge in common and use knowledge to coordinate their activities. 
In p. 25 the paper explains the notion of ‘activity awareness'. The goal is to shift the focus on static shared concepts (knowledge) to dynamic shared activity. The term ‘activity' takes from Activity Theory, which puts human behavior in an organized and contextualized framework.
The paper discusses four facets of activity awareness: common ground (Clark, 1996), community of practice (Wenger et al. 2002), social capital (Coleman, 1988), and human development (Vygotsky, 1978). It uses a hypothetical emergency management scenario (forest fire fighters).
Finally, the paper lists examples of design implications. One principle is that activity awareness should be supported with no extra attention and effort.},

abstract = {There is an increasing awareness that the articulation of forensic science and criminal investigation is critical to the resolution of crimes. However, models and methods to support an effective collaboration between the partners are still poorly expressed or even lacking.Three propositions are borrowed from crime intelligence methods in order to bridge this gap: (a) the general intelligence process, (b) the analyses of investigative problems along principal perspectives: entities and their relationships, time and space, quantitative aspects and (c) visualisation methods as a mode of expression of a problem in these dimensions.Indeed, in a collaborative framework, different kinds of visualisations integrating forensic case data can play a central role for supporting decisions. Among them, link-charts are scrutinised for their abilities to structure and ease the analysis of a case by describing how relevant entities are connected. However, designing an informative chart that does not bias the reasoning process is not straightforward. Using visualisation as a catalyser for a collaborative approach integrating forensic data thus calls for better specifications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Forensic Science Society.},

In this article we examine two coordination processes that are impacted by visual information—situation awareness and conversational grounding—which are theoretically distinct but often confounded in empirical research. We present three empirical studies that demonstrate how sharedvisual infor- mation supports collaboration through these two distinct routes.We also address how particular features of visual information interact with features of the task to influence situation awareness and conversational grounding, and further demonstrate how these features affect conversation and coor- dination. Experiment 1 manipulates the immediacy of the visual informa- tion and shows that immediate visual feedback facilitates collaboration by improving both situation awareness and conversational grounding. In Ex- periment 2, by misaligning the perspective through which theWorker and Helper see the work area we disrupt the ability of visual feedback to sup- port conversational grounding but not situation awareness.The findings demonstrate that visual information supports the central mechanism of conversational grounding.

However, the use of these tools has not been studied outside of the laboratory, and as collaborative search becomes increasingly commonplace in everyday life, there is a need to understand whether the support provided by collaborative search systems fits with real-world information seeking prac- tices. In the present study, we deployed two collaborative search tools to pairs of searchers with genuine information needs. We report findings from in-depth interviews conducted after searchers had used their assigned system for an extended period of time. Our findings show how system features were used and appropriated in pursuit of collaboration, throwing light on the way in which collaborative search is conducted in quotidian settings. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.},

abstract = {Visual analytics is inherently a collaboration between human and computer. However, in current visual analytics systems, the computer has limited means of knowing about its users and their analysis processes. While existing research has shown that a user{\&}{\#}x2019;s interactions with a system reflect a large amount of the user{\&}{\#}x2019;s reasoning process, there has been limited advancement in developing automated, real-time techniques that mine interactions to learn about the user. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict a user{\&}{\#}x2019;s task performance and infer some user personality traits by using machine learning techniques to analyze interaction data. Specifically, we conduct an experiment in which participants perform a visual search task, and apply well-known machine learning algorithms to three encodings of the users{\&}{\#}x2019; interaction data. We achieve, depending on algorithm and encoding, between 62{\%} and 83{\%} accuracy at predicting whether each user will be fast or slow at completing the task. Beyond predicting performance, we demonstrate that using the same techniques, we can infer aspects of the user{\&}{\#}x2019;s personality factors, including locus of control, extraversion, and neuroticism. Further analyses show that strong results can be attained with limited observation time: in one case 95{\%} of the final accuracy is gained after a quarter of the average task completion time. Overall, our findings show that interactions can provide information to the computer about its human collaborator, and establish a foundation for realizing mixedinitiative visual analytics systems.},

abstract = {Workspace awareness support is mandatory for group support systems. It allows users not only to follow actions of others, but to understand and respond to any changes others make to the workspace. In this paper, we present a novel approach for asynchronous awareness support by offering different filters to retrieve relevant awareness information and visualizing the evolution of the shared artifact. We illustrate our approach with a tool for collaborative non-linear storytelling in which users can jointly create a story graph of interconnected audio files. Such a story graph is an example for a non- linear story. We describe the development of a prototype that visualizes how the collaborative story has evolved over time. We evaluate our approach for asynchronous awareness support in an experiment with 40 participants exploring story graphs of different complexity. The evaluation results show that our visualization approach helps group members to assess who has modified the shared story, how it was modified, what exactly has been modified, and when it has been modified.},

@article{Clemmensen2016,
abstract = {ABSTRACTThis paper reports a study of the use of activity theory in human–computer interaction (HCI) research. We analyse activity theory in HCI since its first appearance about 25 years ago. Through an analysis and meta-synthesis of 109 selected HCI activity theory papers, we created a taxonomy of 5 different ways of using activity theory: (1) analysing unique features, principles, and problematic aspects of the theory; (2) identifying domain-specific requirements for new theoretical tools; (3) developing new conceptual accounts of issues in the field of HCI; (4) guiding and supporting empirical analyses of HCI phenomena; and (5) providing new design illustrations, claims, and guidelines. We conclude that HCI researchers are not only users of imported theory, but also theory-makers who adapt and develop theory for different purposes.},

@article{Guo2016,
abstract = {We present results from an experiment aimed at using logs of interactions with a visual analytics application to better understand how interactions lead to insight generation. We performed an insight-based user study of a visual analytics application and ran post hoc quantitative analyses of participants' measured insight metrics and interaction logs. The quantitative analyses identified features of interaction that were correlated with insight characteristics, and we confirmed these findings using a qualitative analysis of video captured during the user study. Results of the experiment include design guidelines for the visual analytics application aimed at supporting insight generation. Furthermore, we demonstrated an analysis method using interaction logs that identified which interaction patterns led to insights, going beyond insight-based evaluations that only quantify insight characteristics. We also discuss choices and pitfalls encountered when applying this analysis method, such as the benefits and costs of applying an abstraction framework to application-specific actions before further analysis. Our method can be applied to evaluations of other visualization tools to inform the design of insight-promoting interactions and to better understand analyst behaviors.},

abstract = {Our study investigated the use of annotations in an asynchronous crime-solving task. In Study 1, regardless of whether they anticipated a partner, participants had better performance if they annotated more about connections across documents. In Study 2, annotations that pointed to more connections across documents improved the performance of the second participant. Annotations that pointed to few connections across documents hurt performance, especially when people were more aware of their partners. This research suggests that future collaborative tools should help people discern useful from useless annotations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Authors.},

@article{Greenberg2001,
abstract = {The Notification Collage (NC) is a groupware system where distributed and co-located colleagues comprising a small community post media elements onto a real-time collaborative surface that all members can see. Akin to collages of information found on public bulletin boards, NC randomly places incoming elements onto this surface. People can post assorted media: live video from desktop cameras; editable sticky notes; activity indicators; slide shows displaying a series of digital photos, snapshots of a person's digital desktop, and web page thumbnails. User experiences show that NC becomes a rich resource for awareness and collaboration. Community members indicate their presence to others by posting live video. They regularly act on this information by engaging in text and video conversations. Because all people can overhear conversations, these become active opportunities to join in. People also post items they believe will be interesting to others, such as desktop snapshots and vacation photos. Finally, people use NC somewhat differently when it is displayed on a large public screen than when it appears on a personal computer.},
