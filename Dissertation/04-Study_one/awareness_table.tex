\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Social awareness\\ \emph{who is present?}\end{tabular}             & CAnalytics helped me stay aware,of my teammates activities because I could see who was logged on in the top,right corner (P123)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\

\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}History awareness\\ \emph{Who has done what?}\end{tabular}         & The way you are able to view when and where your teammate made or updated annotations/information was the key to staying aware of what your team has done. It is a great tool in respects to that. For example, I was able to view the changes my team made while I was not using the CAnalytics tool at the same time they were using the history tab. (P171)                               \\

\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Information awareness\\ \emph{What is being changed?}\end{tabular} & CAnalyitics was very helpful in keeping us updated on what was being changed/noted/amended by whom and when. This was very beneficial for staying on the same page and knowing what changes were being made so no one individual was out of the loop. (P157)                                                                                                                                 \\
\rowcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Action awareness\\ \emph{Who is doing what?}\end{tabular}          & I liked how you could always see what your teammate were viewing on the website. For example I was working on the bluf when my teammates were working on the network part of the program. If I were to come across a piece of information that I thought might be helpful to them I would just tell them. My teammates did the same thing in return. (P51)                                   \\
\rowcolor[HTML]{C0C0C0}
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Intention awareness\\ \emph{Who is going to do what?}\end{tabular} & CAnalytics showed what tab {[}tool{]} my teammates were working on which helped me be aware of what they were working on. For example, if I saw that one of my teammates was on the network tab, I knew that they were attempting to connect the information that was relevant to one another.,I would then be able to mention any new findings I had that could influence their work (P160)
