@article{Zhou2006,
abstract = {Intelligence analysis is a process of evaluating and transforming raw data into descriptions, explanations, and conclusions for intelligence consumers. It requires exploring multiple competing hypotheses in an attempt to formulate a more realistic model of the world to better describe or explain current events or predict likely future events. For example, government analysts may hypothesize the capabilities and intentions of terrorist groups to understand the threat of possible terror attacks; financial analysts may examine business and market information to evaluate potential investment candidates. An intelligence analyst is an individual who performs intelligence analysis of a given situation. Intelligence analysis is a very difficult task because of the complexity of the problems addressed and the inherent limitations in human cognitive processes [1]. First, intelligence analysts must deal with much uncertainty due to often incomplete and inconsistent information. Second, human analysts are likely to form cognitive biases toward a particular hypothesis. The difficulty of the task increases when analysts must deal with large amounts of dynamically updated, transient information (e.g., surveillance videos). To tackle such a difficult task, analysts normally take a targetcentric approach [2]. Specifically, analysts first formulate their hypotheses, and then validate the hypotheses by gathering and distilling information from various sources. During a hypothesis validation process, relevant information would be retrieved and marked as evidence, which either supports or refutes a hypothesis. As intelligence analysis becomes an increasingly important area for many sectors (e.g., government, finance, and pharmaceuticals), researchers and practitioners have developed a wide range of computer technologies and tools to aid human analysts in performing their tasks. However, most of the efforts focus on information search (e.g., QA-based information retrieval) or information analytics (e.g., data mining and video analysis). Limited attention has been devoted to providing better user interfaces through which human analysts can better manage a complex analysis process. With the current far-from-perfect information search and analytic technologies, we believe that it is critical to create a ``smart'' interactive environment where human analysts and computers can work collaboratively. On the one hand, computers use the human analysis process as a context to better understand the needs of analysts and assist them in their tasks (e.g., reminding them to investigate competitive hypotheses). On the other hand, human analysts could use computer-presented information as a context to better articulate their needs (e.g., issuing follow-up inquiries) and manage their analysis process (e.g., better organizing hypotheses and marshaling evidence). The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners who are interested in developing and applying the state-of-art intelligent user interface (IUI) technologies to enhance intelligence analysis. Ideally, the developed IUI technologies or tools can capitalize on human strength (e.g., reasoning and detecting visual patterns) and leverage machine automation to overcome scaling and complexity challenges.},

In this paper we describe a distributed geo-collaboration software prototype. The system design rationale was gleaned from fieldwork, literature on team cognition, and an earlier lab study introducing a reference task with face-to-face teams. We report on a controlled experiment that evaluates this design rationale. Distinct sets of measures show that that the prototype supported both content and process common ground, offsetting the costs imposed by the distributed setting. We interpret the results in relation to prior work on common ground and draw implications for moving beyond current models of sharing and coordination.},

They are apt to accept "con-firming" evidence at face value while subjecting "discontinuing" evidence to critical evaluation, and as a result to draw undue support for their initial posi-tions from mixed or random empirical findings. Thus, the result of exposing contending factions in a social dispute to an identical body of relevant em-pirical evidence may be not a narrowing of disagreement but rather an in-crease in polarization. To test these assumptions and predictions, subjects supporting and opposing capital punishment were exposed to two purported studies, one seemingly confirming and one seemingly disconfirming their exist-ing beliefs about the deterrent efficacy of the death penalty. As predicted, both proponents and opponents of capital punishment rated those results and procedures that confirmed their own beliefs to be the more convincing and probative ones, and they reported corresponding shifts in their beliefs as the various results and procedures were presented. The net effect of such evalua-tions and opinion shifts was the postulated increase in attitude polarization.},

This opens up new ways of working together. We examined the data traces of collaborative writing behavior in student teams' use of Google Docs to discover how they are writing together now. We found that student teams write both synchronously and asynchronously, take fluid roles in the writing and editing of the documents, and show a variety of styles of collaborative writing, including writing from scratch, beginning with an outline, pasting in a related example as a template to organize their own writing, and three more. We also found that the document serves as a place where they share a number of things not included in the final document, including links or references to related materials, the assignment requirements from the instructor, and informal discussions to coordinate the collaboration or to structure the document. We computed a number of measures to depict a group's collaboration behavior and asked external graders to score these documents for quality. We found that the documents that included balanced participation and/or exhibited leadership were judged higher in quality, as were those that were longer. We then suggested system design implications and behavioral guidelines to support people writing together better, and concluded the paper with future research directions.},

abstract = {Software tools that make it easier for analysts to collaborate as a natural part of their work will lead to better analysis that is informed by more perspectives. We are interested to know if software tools can be designed that support collaboration even as they allow analysts to find documents and organize information (including evidence, schemas, and hypotheses). We have modified the Entity Workspace system, described previously, to test such designs. We have evaluated the resulting design in both a laboratory study and a study where it is situated with an analysis team. In both cases, effects on collaboration appear to be positive. Key aspects of the design include an evidence notebook optimized for organizing entities (rather than text characters), information structures that can be collapsed and expanded, visualization of evidence that emphasizes events and documents (rather than emphasizing the entity graph), and a notification system that finds entities of mutual interest to multiple analysts. Long-term tests suggest that this approach can support both top-down and bottom-up styles of analysis.},

@article{Greenberg1990,
abstract = {Although work is frequently collaborative, most computer-based activities revolve around software packages designed to be used by one person at a time. To get around this, people working together often talk and gesture around a computer screen, perhaps taking turns interacting with the running “single-user” application by passing the keyboard around. However, it is technically possible to share these unaltered applications—even though they were originally designed for a single user only—across physically different workstations through special view-sharing software. Each person sees the same image of the running application on their own screen, and has an opportunity to interact with it by taking turns. This paper discusses the various roles and responsibilities of the view-sharing software that must be considered during its design and evaluation: view management, floor control, conference registration by participants, and handling of meta-level communications. A brief survey of existing shared view systems is provided for background.},

In this article we examine two coordination processes that are impacted by visual information—situation awareness and conversational grounding—which are theoretically distinct but often confounded in empirical research. We present three empirical studies that demonstrate how sharedvisual infor- mation supports collaboration through these two distinct routes.We also address how particular features of visual information interact with features of the task to influence situation awareness and conversational grounding, and further demonstrate how these features affect conversation and coor- dination. Experiment 1 manipulates the immediacy of the visual informa- tion and shows that immediate visual feedback facilitates collaboration by improving both situation awareness and conversational grounding. In Ex- periment 2, by misaligning the perspective through which theWorker and Helper see the work area we disrupt the ability of visual feedback to sup- port conversational grounding but not situation awareness.The findings demonstrate that visual information supports the central mechanism of conversational grounding. Experiment 3 disrupts the ability of visual feed- back to support situation awareness by reducing the size of the common Darren},

We extend prior work to study the effect of shared information on collaboration. We analyzed the success and discussion process of remote pairs trying to identify a serial killer in multiple crime cases. Each partner had half of the evidence, or each partner had all the available evidence. Pairs also used one of three tools: spreadsheet only (control condition), unshared visualizations, or shared visualization. Visualizations improved analysis over the control condition but this improvement depended on how much evidence each partner had. When each partner possessed all the evidence with visualizations, discussion flagged and pairs showed evidence of more confirmation bias. They discussed fewer hypotheses and persisted on the wrong hypothesis. We discuss the possible reasons for this phenomenon and implications for design of remote collaboration systems to incorporate awareness of intermediate processes important to collaborative success.},

In distributed projects where opportunities for personal communication are limited, the design documentation is an important surrogate. This study has investigated the perceived effectiveness of boundary objects in a distributed agile team, and their role in communicating target user needs. Six in-depth interviews with UCD specialists showed that the boundary objects rarely communicate underlying needs of the users but rather focus on interaction with the system that is being developed. The used boundary objects also do not work as stand-alone deliverables; they need to be explained and elaborated. Making the boundary objects comprehensive enough to be stand-alone is seen as too time consuming and not worth the effort. For agile projects with distributed teams, this creates hand-over and follow-up problems.},

It allows users not only to follow actions of others, but to understand and respond to any changes others make to the workspace. In this paper, we present a novel approach for asynchronous awareness support by offering different filters to retrieve relevant awareness information and visualizing the evolution of the shared artifact. We illustrate our approach with a tool for collaborative non-linear storytelling in which users can jointly create a story graph of interconnected audio files. Such a story graph is an example for a non- linear story. We describe the development of a prototype that visualizes how the collaborative story has evolved over time. We evaluate our approach for asynchronous awareness support in an experiment with 40 participants exploring story graphs of different complexity. The evaluation results show that our visualization approach helps group members to assess who has modified the shared story, how it was modified, what exactly has been modified, and when it has been modified.},

While the visualization result is important, the path to the result might be as valuable. One task of visual analytics is to capture and visually analyze the discovery process.

In addition to the data itself, how a piece of data relates to the overall data space, user space, and application space is of equal importance. The interaction among collaborators are as valuable as data itself.

The focus of visual analytics is not the creation of a "product" (a set of visualizations), but an increased understanding or insight into a dataset, a consensus, or the ability to make informed decisions.},

They are "wicked" problems, whereas science has developed to deal with "tame" problems. Policy problems cannot be definitively described. Moreover, in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the undisputable public good; there is no objective definition of equity; policies that respond to social problems cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no sense to talk about "optinaal solutions" to social probIems unless severe qualifications are imposed first. Even worse, there are no "solutions" in the sense of definitive and objective answers.},

annote = {This paper focuses on Collaborative Information Behavior (CIB) and discusses the differences from Individual Information Behavior (IIB).

The paper puts forward a CIB model, viewing the information environment from two axes:1)Behavior axis; 2) Context axis. Behavior includes information searching and seeking (I wonder the difference), and context ranges from individual to collaborative.Also, the paper identifies some "triggers" that cause the shift from IIB to CIB. 

The method adopted in this paper is to study two patient care teams and identifies how they communicate and collaborate.

To understand CIB, we have to develop both a better conceptual understanding and system.And a good CIB system should include the four features: 1)Awareness 2)Chat 3)Conferencing 4)Visualization.

The paper introduces a prototype "MUSE", that has the chat, search and share function. Though the system provides certain support to collaboration, the function is obviously limited. For instance, no conferencing is supported. That means only two people are allowed, thus no awareness is introduced. The information is shared "blindly", with no idea who is really interested in it. 

Besides, the CIB model is too simple. Can it truly reflect the collaboration in real life?},

abstract = {Maintaining an awareness of collaborators' actions is critical during collaborative work, including during collaborative visualization activities. Particularly when collaborators are located at a distance, it is important to know what everyone is working on in order to avoid duplication of effort, share relevant results in a timely manner and build upon each other's results. Can a person's brushing actions provide an indication of their queries and interests in a data set? Can these actions be revealed to a collaborator without substantially disrupting their own independent work? We designed a study to answer these questions in the context of distributed collaborative visualization of tabular data. Participants in our study worked independently to answer questions about a tabular data set, while simultaneously viewing brushing actions of a fictitious collaborator, shown directly within a shared workspace. We compared three methods of presenting the collaborator's actions: brushing {\&} linking (i.e. highlighting exactly what the collaborator would see), selection (i.e. showing only a selected item), and persistent selection (i.e. showing only selected items but having them persist for some time). Our results demonstrated that persistent selection enabled some awareness of the collaborator's activities while causing minimal interference with independent work. Other techniques were less effective at providing awareness, and brushing {\&} linking caused substantial interference. These findings suggest promise for the idea of exploiting natural brushing actions to provide awareness in collaborative work.},

abstract = {As children now spend considerable time reading electronic media, digital reading skills and good reading comprehension are essential. However, many studies agree that screen-based reading leads to shallow reading, short attention spans, and poor comprehension. Therefore, this work presents a collaborative reading annotation system with a reading annotation and interactive discussion scaffold (CRAS-RAIDS) for improving reading performance in collaborative digital reading environments. This study used a quasi-experimental design. Fifty-three Grade 5 students were recruited from two classes of an elementary school in Taoyuan County, Taiwan. One class was randomly designated the experimental group used the proposed CRAS-RAIDS support for collaborative reading. The other class was designated the control group and used the traditional paper-based reading annotation method and face-to-face discussions. The two groups were then compared in terms of reading attitude, reading comprehension, and use of reading strategy in an active reading context. Analytical results show that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in direct and explicit comprehension, inferential comprehension performance, and use of reading strategy. Moreover, the experimental group, but not the control group, had a significantly improved reading attitude in the total dimensions and in the behavioral and affective sub-dimensions. Additionally, the experimental group showed positive interest and high learning satisfaction. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

While we-awareness is easy afforded in face to face collocated collaboration, it is much more difficult to design distributed groupware tools to provide equivalent capabilities: there can be no awareness unless it is programmed in via system features. We identify a series of questions that must be considered if we-awareness is to be supported. What types of awareness information is crucial and should thus be added to the blank slate of a screen sharing system? How can that awareness information be captured through technology, and what information will be lost during this capture process? How should that information be translated, transformed and encoded into a digital form, andas part of thatwhat information will be altered as part of that translation process? How will that information be transmitted, and what are the network effects in terms of that information being received in a timely manner? How will that information be represented to other participants in order to enable the rich and subtle interactions that occur in the face-to-face setting? We illustrate the nuances of these questions and why they are difficult to answer by revisiting several prior technical solutions to we-awareness.},

In this paper, we present the results from a user study designed to explore the ways in which analysts gather and process information. The study asked three subjects to perform two different analytical tasks. The tasks were designed to gather observations from two points in the analytical process: (1) the beginning of an investigation, where little context is available, and (2) the middle stages of the analytical process, where there can be significant context based on gathered evidence and developed target models. We discuss both the study methodol-ogy and key results. Our results include observations of how ana-lysts formulate information requests and process the results.},

A few frameworks and taxonomies of Infovis interaction techniques exist, but they typically focus on low-level operations and do not address the variety of benefits interaction provides. After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTThis paper reports a study of the use of activity theory in human–computer interaction (HCI) research. We analyse activity theory in HCI since its first appearance about 25 years ago. Through an analysis and meta-synthesis of 109 selected HCI activity theory papers, we created a taxonomy of 5 different ways of using activity theory: (1) analysing unique features, principles, and problematic aspects of the theory; (2) identifying domain-specific requirements for new theoretical tools; (3) developing new conceptual accounts of issues in the field of HCI; (4) guiding and supporting empirical analyses of HCI phenomena; and (5) providing new design illustrations, claims, and guidelines. We conclude that HCI researchers are not only users of imported theory, but also theory-makers who adapt and develop theory for different purposes.},

It requires phases of linear as well as creativity oriented work.Also phases of collaborative work have to alternatewithwork in solitude, requiring a smooth transition between them. This in turn results in awareness becoming a crucial factor. Within the context of designing socio-technical processes through modeling we have developed tools and methods to integrate individual and collaborative creativity into modeling with special respect to awareness thus allowing for a smooth transition between phases of working in solitude and phases of collaboration.We have conductedmultiple experiments on the subject following an action research approach which allowed for reflecting on the influence of awareness on collaborative process design in co-located meetings while also improving the socio-technical setting they were applied in. Derived fromour findings we show requirements for further development of the socio-technical setting and show future directions such as the integration of the described setting into other areas of design.},

We performed an insight-based user study of a visual analytics application and ran post hoc quantitative analyses of participants' measured insight metrics and interaction logs. The quantitative analyses identified features of interaction that were correlated with insight characteristics, and we confirmed these findings using a qualitative analysis of video captured during the user study. Results of the experiment include design guidelines for the visual analytics application aimed at supporting insight generation. Furthermore, we demonstrated an analysis method using interaction logs that identified which interaction patterns led to insights, going beyond insight-based evaluations that only quantify insight characteristics. We also discuss choices and pitfalls encountered when applying this analysis method, such as the benefits and costs of applying an abstraction framework to application-specific actions before further analysis. Our method can be applied to evaluations of other visualization tools to inform the design of insight-promoting interactions and to better understand analyst behaviors.},

Subjective evaluations of 10 workload-related factors were obtained from 16 different experiments. The experimental tasks included simple cognitive and manual control tasks, complex laboratory and supervisory control tasks, and aircraft simulation. Task-, behavior-, and subject-related correlates of subjective workload experiences varied as a function of difficulty manipulations within experiments, different sources of workload between experiments, and individual differences in workload definition. A multi-dimensional rating scale is proposed in which information about the magnitude and sources of six workload-related factors are combined to derive a sensitive and reliable estimate of workload. ?? 1988.},

However, models and methods to support an effective collaboration between the partners are still poorly expressed or even lacking.Three propositions are borrowed from crime intelligence methods in order to bridge this gap: (a) the general intelligence process, (b) the analyses of investigative problems along principal perspectives: entities and their relationships, time and space, quantitative aspects and (c) visualisation methods as a mode of expression of a problem in these dimensions.Indeed, in a collaborative framework, different kinds of visualisations integrating forensic case data can play a central role for supporting decisions. Among them, link-charts are scrutinised for their abilities to structure and ease the analysis of a case by describing how relevant entities are connected. However, designing an informative chart that does not bias the reasoning process is not straightforward. Using visualisation as a catalyser for a collaborative approach integrating forensic data thus calls for better specifications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Forensic Science Society.},

abstract = {Visual analytics is inherently a collaboration between human and computer. However, in current visual analytics systems, the computer has limited means of knowing about its users and their analysis processes. While existing research has shown that a user{\&}{\#}x2019;s interactions with a system reflect a large amount of the user{\&}{\#}x2019;s reasoning process, there has been limited advancement in developing automated, real-time techniques that mine interactions to learn about the user. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict a user{\&}{\#}x2019;s task performance and infer some user personality traits by using machine learning techniques to analyze interaction data. Specifically, we conduct an experiment in which participants perform a visual search task, and apply well-known machine learning algorithms to three encodings of the users{\&}{\#}x2019; interaction data. We achieve, depending on algorithm and encoding, between 62{\%} and 83{\%} accuracy at predicting whether each user will be fast or slow at completing the task. Beyond predicting performance, we demonstrate that using the same techniques, we can infer aspects of the user{\&}{\#}x2019;s personality factors, including locus of control, extraversion, and neuroticism. Further analyses show that strong results can be attained with limited observation time: in one case 95{\%} of the final accuracy is gained after a quarter of the average task completion time. Overall, our findings show that interactions can provide information to the computer about its human collaborator, and establish a foundation for realizing mixedinitiative visual analytics systems.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In the present study, we deployed two collaborative search tools to pairs of searchers with genuine information needs. We report findings from in-depth interviews conducted after searchers had used their assigned system for an extended period of time. Our findings show how system features were used and appropriated in pursuit of collaboration, throwing light on the way in which collaborative search is conducted in quotidian settings. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.},

annote = {Critique the notion of knowledge in common in shared mental model. On one hand, the model dismisses the possibility of complementary knowledge--a participant does not need to know knowledge in other members, but knows what others know, the so-called ‘transactive memory'. On the other hand, shared mental model is static, while group mental model keeps evolving as communication and interaction proceed. It is more important to know how collaborators identify knowledge in common and use knowledge to coordinate their activities. 
In p. 25 the paper explains the notion of ‘activity awareness'. The goal is to shift the focus on static shared concepts (knowledge) to dynamic shared activity. The term ‘activity' takes from Activity Theory, which puts human behavior in an organized and contextualized framework.
The paper discusses four facets of activity awareness: common ground (Clark, 1996), community of practice (Wenger et al. 2002), social capital (Coleman, 1988), and human development (Vygotsky, 1978). It uses a hypothetical emergency management scenario (forest fire fighters).
Finally, the paper lists examples of design implications. One principle is that activity awareness should be supported with no extra attention and effort.},

abstract = {Asynchronous collaborative analysis is important in many fields, but information sharing can be a bottleneck. Tools for annotating, organizing, and summarizing information can help, but their value will likely depend on the accuracy of teammates' information. To document this claim, two experiments examined participants' performance on a complex detective task when they asynchronously received information from a teammate in a collaboration tool or received no such information. We found that receiving a progress report containing accurate information was associated with improved performance (vs. no information shared in a tool) but worse performance when the information was inaccurate. Teammates were evaluated as helpful even when they were not. Our findings point to a phenomenon of teammate inaccuracy blindness that arises when teammates provide inaccurate information. We propose some strategies for helping collaborators avoid or lessen this effect.},

@article{Karvetski2013,
abstract = {Intelligence analysis often tackles questions shrouded by deep uncer- tainty, such as those that deal with chemical and biological terrorism or nuclear weapon detection. In dealing with such questions, the task falls on intelligence analysts to assemble collected items of information and determine the consistency of the body of reporting with a set of conflicting hypotheses. One popular procedure within the Intelligence Community for distinguishing a hypothesis that is ‘‘least inconsistent'' with evidence is analysis of competing hypotheses (ACH). Although ACH aims at reducing confirmation bias, as typically implemented, it can fall short in diagramming the relationships between hypotheses and items of evidence, determining where assumptions fit into the modeling framework, and providing a suitable model for ‘‘what-if'' sensitivity analysis. This paper describes a facilitated process that uses Bayesian networks to (1) provide a clear probabilistic character- ization of the uncertainty associated with competing hypotheses, and (2) prioritize information gathering among the remaining unknowns. We illustrate the process using the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in The Dalles, Oregon, USA.},

@article{Heer2012,
abstract = {The increasing scale and availability of digital data provides an extraordinary resource for informing public policy, scientific discovery, business strategy, and even our personal lives. To get the most out of such data, however, users must be able to make sense of it: to pursue questions, uncover patterns of interest, and identify (and potentially correct) errors. In concert with data-management systems and statistical algorithms, analysis requires contextualized human judgments regarding the domain- specific significance of the clusters, trends, and outliers discovered in data. Visualization provides a powerful means of making sense of data. By mapping data attributes to visual properties such as position, size, shape, and color, visualization designers leverage perceptual skills to help users discern and interpret patterns within data.11 A single image, however, typically provides answers to, at best, a handful of questions. Instead, visual analysis typically progresses in an iterative process of view creation, exploration, and refinement. Meaningful analysis consists of repeated explorations as users develop insights about significant relationships, domain-specific contextual influences, and causal patterns. Confusing widgets, complex dialog boxes, hidden operations, incomprehensible displays, or slow response times can limit the range and depth of topics considered and may curtail thorough deliberation and introduce errors. To be most effective, visual analytics tools must support the fluent and flexible use of visualizations at rates resonant with the pace of human thought. The goal of this article is to assist designers, researchers, professional analysts, procurement officers, educators, and students in evaluating and creating visual analysis tools. We present a taxonomy of interactive dynamics that contribute to successful analytic dialogues. The},

abstract = {The paper discusses the definition of awaareness in CSCW. The term "awareness" is found ambiguous and has been used in various ways. For instance, awareness was initially adopted to denote practices through which cooperative activities are tacitly and unobtrusively aligned and integrated, but are now sometimes used to conceptualize the use of instant messaging system. The term is also often used with different adjectives, e.g. "general awareness", "collaborative awareness" "peripheral awareness" "background awareness" "passive awareness" "reciprocal awareness" "mutual awareness" "workspace awareness", etc. The first question to address with is of what cooperative actors are supposedly aware, or aware of what? The paper summarizes that it is aware of social context, and may lead to "informal interaction" and "a shared culture". Awareness is also used to denote those practices through which actors tacitly and seamlessly align and integrate their distributed and yet interdependent activities. The paper also distinguishes the difference between awareness and attention, or focus. Awareness is gathered "passively", while other workplace activities progress. Finally the paper talks about how awareness is gained so effortlessly without interrupting the current line of work. On the one hand, actors "monitor" the activities of their colleagues in the setting which doesn't require a response from them. On the other hand, actors display their activities that might be relevant to their colleagues. Besides, actors can gain awareness effortless because the world is "meaningful" to them.},

People can post assorted media: live video from desktop cameras; editable sticky notes; activity indicators; slide shows displaying a series of digital photos, snapshots of a person's digital desktop, and web page thumbnails. User experiences show that NC becomes a rich resource for awareness and collaboration. Community members indicate their presence to others by posting live video. They regularly act on this information by engaging in text and video conversations. Because all people can overhear conversations, these become active opportunities to join in. People also post items they believe will be interesting to others, such as desktop snapshots and vacation photos.

Based on a survey and follow-up interviews with CiteSeer users, we present four novel implications for designing the CiteSeer collaboratory. First, visualize query-based social networks to identify scholarly communities of interest. Second, provide online collaborative tool support for upstream stages of scientific collaboration. Third, support activity awareness for staying cognizant of online scientific activities. Fourth, use notification systems to convey scientific activity awareness. We discuss how these implications can broadly enhance e-science usability for collaboratory infrastructures based on digital libraries. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
