# Introduction

## Difference from Study One

Tool improvement:

1. Structured hypothesis development
2. View as resource (sharable, extendable, and reusable)
3. Bug fixes: e.g. filter
4. Improved log: capture more fine-tuned interactions

Setting change:

We had some manipulation (more control) over the study setting

1. Participants were assigned different roles and had a different set of documents. Information sharing was more challenging because participants must share all relevant information from their own documents to reach the right conclusion. A well known issue in information sharing is hidden profile; that is, teams tend to share and discuss information that is already known to the members, resulting in overlook of information that is less known but equally important.
2. The task is well structured, designed in a way that unique information is equally distributed among teammates. The task is close ended, with a single solution. This helps assessment of team performance.
