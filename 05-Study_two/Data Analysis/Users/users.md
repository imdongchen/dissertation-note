# Participants

8 teams (25 users) submitted Phase 1 report, 8 teams (24 users) submitted Phase
2 report, and 7 teams submitted both reports. 17 students finished the
questionnaire. Team 164 consisted of four members, so their data was also excluded. In our analysis, we focused on the 6 teams that completed both
tasks. Of the 6 teams, one team (Team 163) chose to use Google Sheet to
schematize the data. Their did not use much of CAnalytics. Therefore we excluded
their interaction in the analysis, but their performance could be a baseline
reference for other teams. In the end, we analyzed 6 teams data.

Of the 18 participants, 14 responded to the pre-survey. 6 were female, 8 were male. The average age was 20.9, with range between 20 to 22. Three of them were junior undergraduate, all others were senior. One reported having no prior experience in team-based intelligence projects. Three students reported having experience in fewer than 3 projects. The other 10 reported having more than 3 project experience. 5 students had used CAnalytics before in a prior class, the rest 9 did not hear of our tool before.
