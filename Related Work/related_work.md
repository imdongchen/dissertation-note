Gergle, Kraut and Fussell used lab experiments to prove that shared visual information improved situation awareness and conversational grounding, respectively.

> Shared visual information helps communicators to establish common ground
by providing evidence from which to infer another’s level of understanding. This evidence can be given off deliberately (e.g., as in a pointing gesture) or as a side effect of proper performance of the desired action, provided both parties are aware of what one another can see. For example, when responding to an instruction, performing the correct action without any verbal communication provides an indication of understanding, whereas performing the wrong action, or even failing to act, can signal misunderstanding (Gergle, Kraut, \& Fussell, 2004a)
