# Future work

Due to the limit of the field study as well as flawed log design (some detail interaction not captured in this version), we could not answer many questions that are important to fully understand user experience. This is a list of questions that we hope to address in future work by implementing a refined log system, and conducting a longitudinal case study.

## How did teams enact multiple analytic techniques?

Analysts reported that they used evidence matrix, timeline analysis, network analysis, and ACH. How did they enact these techniques and results? On the team level, how did they coordinate using these techniques?


## How did teams interweave data modeling and analysis?

We observed that teams interwove data modeling and analysis in the process by looking their action sequence graph and state transition graph. However we lack understanding when they decided to switch from analysis to modeling and vise versa. Especially when working as a team, is that switching a team coordinated strategy or individual-led activity?
