# Participants

Of the 98 students enrolled in the course (from two sections), 73 consented to participate in the study. They were randomly assigned by the instructor into 25 small teams (23 three-person teams and 2 two-person teams).

Team 93 and Team 105 (team IDs are random) were two-member teams. Since group size is an important factor that influences group behavior, two-person teams may behave qualitatively differently from three-person teams. We thus excluded the two two-person team data from the analysis. Also, from the log (and comfirmed by their answer to the questionnaire), we find that Team 111 spent little time on CAnalytics, thus their data was also excluded. In total, we analyzed the data from 22 teams.

All the students held major in this program. Most (75\%) of them are in the third academic year (3.05 years in average), indicating that participants in our study had relatively advanced experience and knowledge in intelligence analysis. Participants' age ranges from 19 to 28 (20.3 in average). 77\% of the participants are male.
