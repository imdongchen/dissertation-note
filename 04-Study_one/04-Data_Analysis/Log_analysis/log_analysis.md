# Log analysis


Count the number of deletions/modifications to someone else's work versus one's own work. This measure was used in [@Andre2014] as an indicator of *territoriality*, the phenomenon of social production blocking.

## Awareness
Awareness is a subjective concept that cannot be measured directly. In prior research, awareness is often *inferred* from team communication, based on the assumption that team members with high awareness are less likely to ask for clarifications, and instead more likely to push information before being asked [@Convertino2011]. A limit of this approach is that team communication must be recorded, and the recorded communication must be manually coded, which is very costly if the collaboration occurs over an extended period of time. Recording communication is obviously impossible in a natural environment as in our case. An alternative is to investigate into what teams *did*, instead of *said*, to infer team awareness.

We measured whether individuals were aware of entities created by teammates, and how soon these entities were accessed by collaborators since created.
