# Subject feedback

## data modeling and analysis

Participants found it efficient to be able to model data and analyze data in one environment. And by having works in one place, they were able to avoid managing files and resources in multiple locations. Users believed it made the analytic workflow more convenient.

> Rather than using IEW tables and other techniques we have learned, we used the CAnalytics program to keep track of important entities. This was quicker and also generated other important aspects of our previous report, like a timeline and map, automatically (P62)

> When we didn’t have CAnalytics, we had a lot of different word documents that we had to share with each other in google documents. With CAnalytics, we were able to keep all the information, network, timeline, and BLUF analysis in one spot that we were all able to view at the same time as a group. (User 155)


Data modeling using a filtering strategy is relatively high demanding for team coordination.

Teams following a filtering strategy found it challenging to coordinate the filtering criteria; that is, teammates could have different judgment for importance or relevance of a piece of evidence, some of which would turn out less useful:

> I felt it was very easy for everyone to get carried away highlighting things which would get out of control and we would have information that was not very important to solving the problem highlighted (User 44)

Teams following an accretion strategy found they had spent too much time modeling useless data. Simply mechanically annotating data did not help them gain further understanding. And since many data are simply noise, they are not only useless, they also add complexity to the visualization and make analysis more difficult.

> We would find ourselves glued to our computer screens, and spent too much time on intelligence gathering rather than analysis (User 135)

> I felt that after we were done annotating, we hadn’t really accomplished anything and that we were no closer to solving the case than when we had started. In the end it didn’t really help that we had annotated the data,


Students also reported problem coordinating strategy of what and how to annotate.

> We had problems coordinating what we should annotate. **We didn’t really have direction and were going about it in different ways**...Some members tried to delete things and some members tried to just change the annotations, which made the problem worse (User 60)

> We had trouble **establishing consistency**. For example, when we were annotating the banks sometimes we would do them as locations and other times we would do them as organizations. (User 136)


A technical problem users reported is about the dynamic visualization. Since the network is force directed, when a new node or a new link is created, the force structure would be recalculated, thus changing the network layout. This could be disturbing when users are reasoning on the relationships on the network structure. Future designs should consider computing the local force of the newly added node/link without affecting global force structure.

## Collaboration

Participants appreciated the collaborative support. They made an analogy to Google Doc. Similar to being able to collaborate on text editing in Google Doc, they were able to collaboratively work with more complex data structure. Participants could contribute simultaneously without getting blocked.

> CAnalytics seemed like the beta-version of an analyst’s notebook that multiple people could work on at once...It was like having an analyst’s version of a google doc... [Previously] all of us could not edit a single document at the same time. With CAnalytics, we were all able to work on everything at once with ease

Participants reported that they could easily integrate team efforts.

>   they [teammates] were able to work directly off something that I had also created. **This ability to work off of each other’s own work allowed us to all contribute to each element of the analytic process**. An example of this would be when I was creating an association chart for one of the bank robberies. I was able to cover my bases and include in the chart all the information that I thought was relevant. At a later time, one of my group members received the document of the same bank robbery and found information he thought should be included in the association chart that I had not included. **He was able to work off of my initial diagram and add and manipulate it in order to include additional relevant information I had missed**. (U31)


The awareness features were received well. When asked what features helped them stay aware of team activities, 28 participants mentioned the tool coordinator, 24 mentioned the notification system, 19 mentioned the history tool, 14 mentioned the real-time update of user-generated data， 12 mentioned the collaborative editor, and 7 mentioned the message tool. While the number of mentions does not simply indicate tool usefulness, it suggests users appropriate these features and are explicitly aware of their support.

<!-- TODO: find literature for these awareness concepts -->

We categorized students' feedback based on the element of awareness, or the essential problem of awareness of *what* [@Schmidt2002], into social awareness, information awareness, action awareness, history awareness, and intention awareness, as shown in Table XX.

<!-- Awareness table in ./awareness.xlsx -->

<!-- consequence of awareness -->

> **If I were to come across a piece of information that I thought might be helpful to them I would just tell them. My teammates did the same thing in return**. (U51)

> If A\*\*\* [Teammate name] was cleaning up the network map, **I knew that working on the same thing might make more clutter at the time** (U146)

<!-- breakdown -->
One major critique is the lack of sharing of intermediate analytic insight for close collaboration. When individuals are exploring visualizations (e.g. zoom, filter, pan, drag, highlight), an insight pops up with a specific visualization state. Students complaint that they could not easily communicate that insight together with the associate views to the team. The team could "be looking at the same information but arranged in completely different ways" (P131). Unable to share immediate insights in the graphic context seems to make communication out of context.

## Learning experience

Students reported that being aware that teammates were contributing motivated themselves to contribute.

>  the notifications every time you saw someone annotated something kept you peace at mind that your teammates are also working efficiently on this project. (U64)

>  During class I wasn’t sure if my teammates were doing work for that class or another thing but then seeing their dot switch between applications on the software and updates pop up on my screen I knew they were doing work for 231. (U141)

>  CAnalytics allowed us to see how much each person had contributed to their work (142)

> The fact that you can see what other teammates are doing and they can see what you are doing creates a sense of accountability in terms of separating the work load. (User 51)
