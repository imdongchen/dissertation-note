# CAnalytics Tutorial - Data Analysis

4. Open the `person table` to learn the people involved (Note: click the plus icon to display details)
5. Open the `Network` window to learn their relationships
6. Network basic operations: zoom in and out; pan; drag node; mouse over node and relationship;
7. Open timeline to learn the events. Timeline basic operations: zoom in and out; pan; mouse over events.
8. Open map to learn the locations. Map basic operations: zoom in and out; change base map; mouse over locations.
9. Do filters to reduce the data in your view!
  10. Open `Timeline` window, zoom into the theft date (Aug 13). We find that Tom and Jeff were playing basketball, and Alex and Baldric were having lunch. Lisa went to New York
  11. Create a hypothesis: Lisa can be eliminated because she went to New York. Note: your current view is automatically saved together with the hypothesis.
  12. Archive Lisa
  12. Create a hypothesis: Tom and Jeff can be eliminated because they were playing basketball (Note: set the hypothesis as a new thread)
  11. Open `Map` window to see the locations those events occurred. We find that the place where Alex and Baldric had lunch - IST - is very close to Rec Hall, where the theft occurred.
  12. Create a hypothesis following the last one: Tom and Jeff should not be eliminated from suspects because their event location was very close to Rec Hall.
  12. Remove the `Timeline` filter
  13. Open `Person table` window and select `Alex` and `Baldric` (Note: hold `shift` to select multiple)
  14. Open `Network` and see events about `Alex` and `Baldric`
  13. Open `Timeline` window, to see events involving `Alex` and `Baldric`. We find `Baldric` had a debt due and transferred money to `Alex` after the theft
  14. Create a hypothesis: Baldric is suspectable. He has the motivation (to pay debt).
10. Watching the view of your teammates!
  16. The visualization windows as well as filter result is shared in real time.
  17. You can still work on other windows (e.g. message) while in watching

## Tips:

1. Use the `filter` function wisely to reduce your data in your view
2. Share your hypotheses promptly
3. Use the `history` window to learn your team activities.
4. If you want to open two of the same windows (for example, you want to work on your network window while watching teammate's network view ), just open two browser tabs!
